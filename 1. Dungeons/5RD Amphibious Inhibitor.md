Regional Location: [[Whitecliff Plateau]]
Subsection: [[Sunken Caverns]]

**Description** 
In the [[Sunken Caverns]], there exists an ancient structure of [[The Many]] hidden deep within the bowels of the watery depths. It was once deactivated, but has since been reactivated by [[Aquan Nations]]. As one swims in the passages within [[Sunken Caverns]], they notice it is very easy to swim, your body feels lighter, the waters glow a warm color, and your vision is not limited by your darkvision as the waters are visible and as bright as the sky above. Inside this variant of [[The 5 Room Dungeon]], there exists guards, some ancient lore about [[The Many]], and a magical inhibitor guarded by a powerful, activated golem. 

**Mechanics**
The Inhibitor causes the following effects in [[Sunken Caverns]]:
1. *Easy to see water*: water is visible out to double the normal range and glows faintly. No area in the waters is considered to be anything less than dim light.
2. *Freedom of Motion*: the waters are easy to swim in, any creature has a swimming speed equal to half their walking speed in here by default. 
3. *Aquan Empowerment*: while active, the magic of the inhibitor has been twisted and now grants augmented powers to the casters of [[Aquan Nations]] that are here. These creatures gain additional water themed spells (to be decided at a later date) that they can cast 1/day for each spell. 

**Breakdown,** [[The 5 Room Dungeon]]
4. *Entrance*:
	1. The entrance way is bubbly and hard to swim through, as the bubble drive you upwards against your swimming strokes. From the stone beneath you, massive groves of bleached looking sea kelp and schools of pale fish can be seen. Through the ripples of bubbles, you can see old stone columns and the dark stone of an ancient looking monument, recent destroyed. 
	2. The area is riddled with sulfuric, bubbling vents that release powerful columns of bubbles upwards
		1. Swimming down through a column is considered to be difficult terrain
		2. Swimming up through a column is considered "forgiving terrain" and you can move 10 ft for every 5 ft spent
	3. In hidden alcoves, a small warband of [[Aquan Nations]] troops stands guard waiting for intruders. Each has a pet shark as per the Sahuaguin aquatic telepathy trait. A Mind Rock Crab stands guard with them as an envoy of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. 
	4. With a DC 13 perception check, a player notices spears being readied behind stone columns. This stops the ambush
	5. This combat should feel very vertical. Bubble columns add difficult movement and terrain. Fields of kelp offer cover and hiding places. Fish swarms attack anyone hurt the past round as a lair action (initiative count 20). Columns of stone here can be tipped over (DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, 4d10 bludgeoning damage). 
	6. After combat, they might choose to investigate what is being guarded. This area is the entrance to a dungeon. It was unlocked by [[Silvan Gile]], an Archwizard for [[Fedorov's Legion]] as a way to empower the heart of [[Aquan Nations]] that are here and to aid in the main quest that they are undertaking: excavating powerful structures (of [[The Many]]) to find a Shard for [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 
	7. The warband has the following magical items on them: [[Nautilus Tablet]], either the [[Coral Lance]], [[Octopus Bracers]], or [[Tidecleaver Greatsword]], [Javelin of Lightning](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:javelin-of-lightning), and [Helm of Underwater Action](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:helm-of-underwater-action). All good candidates. Make sure to USE the items if they are available to be looted. There is also 150 gold. 
	8. With a DC 15 Investigation/Arcana check, there are clear signs of powerful magic being used to blast apart this area.
	9. With a DC 13 History check, it is clear that this area was once some for of building from long ago, but was recently destroyed. 
5. *Puzzle*:
	1. The entrance puzzle for this is easy -- it does not have to be solved already, at least not by [[Aquan Nations]]. It can still be locked since the "entrance" is just the troops of [[Aquan Nations]] protecting the entrance because [[Fedorov's Legion]] (and by direct orders of [[Silvan Gile]]) ordered them to do it. 
	2. This entrance is a barrier and is impossible to open without completing the puzzle. The inside of the dungeon is not filled with water and the outside is, opening the door leads to a torrent rushing in. 
	3. I think we can use the [[Contaminated Hamiltonian Puzzle]] maybe? We could set this up with a double puzzle, a simple entrance puzzle followed by a more complex puzzle that leads to the device. The second puzzle should be a physical threat. The first puzzle should be a solve it and go kind of puzzle. 
	4. I want the second puzzle to intentionally split the group. Two per one puzzle, two per the other. Then when they escape the puzzles, they end up in two rooms separated by a thick wall of see-through crystal. Two in one room, two in the other. Then we end up in the setback and the battle there. 
	5. There are 4 keys in the battle, two blue and two red. The door on one room is red, and that room has the blue keys. The other door in one room is blue, and that room has the red keys. The keys can be inserted into a metal panel next to the large doors. Inserting both and turning them opens the other rooms door. Both doors open into another passage way. Traversing this passage way leads to the climax room with the inhibitor and golem. Opening a door hear must not lead to the final room, there must be another, non-locked door cutting off the path and the exits of both rooms must lead to each other first. 
6. *Setback*
	1. The setback should be a simple challenge that is a precursor to the main battle. The main battle will have a construct golem created to protect the newly activated Inhibitor. The precursor needs to allude to this.
	2. The Golem should be wildly too powerful for the group. It should have vast AC and Hitpoints and deal MASSIVE burst damage. The goal should be to, if the party does not find the secret, to obliterate at least one member instantly and then encourage them to retreat. 
	3. In this room we should have remains of attempted golem creations, form these small rock golems, weak but in large quantities should appear slowly, over the course of multiple rounds of combat. Have each exhibit SOME of the real golems strengths and some of its weakness.
	4. In this room, in this fight, there will be clear signs of math work and rune work done on the walls in scribing and chalk doing math and calculations, not only to enable the inhibitor, but to craft and create a powerful golem guardian to protect it. There is clear indication here that this inhibitor was SOMETHING ancient and was once a defense mechanism or a mechanism designed to augment life and make it easier, but that it has been transmuted into a inhibitor for the negative effects of the waters of [[Sunken Caverns]]
7. *Climax*
	1. Inside the final room, there are two main things: a powerful golem, conjured by an Archmage [[Silvan Gile]], and the inhibitor, which is fully activated. 
	2. This room is dry and airtight, apart from the entrance. There are conduits on the ceiling that channel the inhibitor's power. 
	3. The Inhibitor: A tall, blue crystal monolith in the center of the room. A channel into the ground rings it. There are three "islands" spaced at 120 degree intervals around it. Each has a pedestal and a floating, spinning orb on top of it. It looks like those orbs could rest perfectly atop each pedestal, but they levitate now. All 3 are blue. Each is 5 ft in diameter. The monolith shimmers a mix of blues and large, pulsing runes glow a faint sea-green upon its form. 
		1. Each orb empowers the monolith
		2. if all three are destroyed, it is deactivated
		3. Each orb has 40 hit points, is only damageable with lightning damage and automatically fails all saving throws. 
	4. The Golem: A huge Stone Golem with thick iron bands and a gargantuan metal sword. It has powerful enchantments on its body. In one hand is a gruesome looking claw with some prototype-looking attachment. It looks to be swirling with magic. A DC 20 Arcana check reveals an enchantment in some way similar to Counterspell. The Sword is huge, far too large to wield by any normal creature. The golem needs to have a VERY clear weakness, but not one the group can just stumble upon blindly. There should be three secrets, findable through the dungeon: one that can reduce the damage of its magical attacks, one that can reduce its AC, and one that removes some of its resistances. 
		1. *Maybe there is a way to factor in flooding this dungeon*. Maybe flooding water in can give some benefit to the fight??
		2. stat block ideas detailed later
	5. Types of Golems that could be used for the fight:
		2. [Smaragadine Golem](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/creature/smaragdine-golem) - I like the magic absorb ability quite a bit, especially considering the golem was created by [[Silvan Gile]]
		3. The Mage Hunter Golem from Tal'Dorei - I like the Antimagic Jolt ability, might twist to be an ability that deals (2d6) psychic per level of spell slot, for the highest spell slot still unused.  So a creature with an un-expended 4th level spell slot would make a DC 18 Wisdom save against (8d6) psychic damage, and then lose that spell slot on a fail. Half damage on a success 
8. *Resolution*
	1. The Inhibitor deactivates and the buffs granted to [[Aquan Nations]] disappear
	2. The depth tolerability in the water goes away
	3. The vision in the water goes away
	4. The warmth of the water goes away
	5. The faint glowing of the water goes away. 


**Some Ideas for the Golem**
- Looking for ways to make an MMORPG battle with the golem in the final room
- *Statistics*
	- Golem will have an AC of 22, enhanced by a shield spell (base would be 17)
	- Golem will have stat array STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA of 26 6 26 3 11 1
		- Very strong, not agile at all
		- Bad intelligence, moderate wisdom to understand instructions, bad charisma its a golem
	- Has Multiattack
		- one part is a Single Target Attack
		- one part is an Antimagic ability
		- The single target attack can be replace by the AoE charge attack
	- Movement speed of 35 feet. 
	- Skills: Athletics +16 (expertise) 
- *Hammer Attack*
	- AoE Charge attack: Massive hammer will slam into the ground. We can have a recharge ability (5-6) that gets used instead of an attack. Will always do at the end of the turn. Instead of immediately hitting a single target with the hammer, it charges up a massive AoE which triggers at the start of the golem's next turn. 
		- 60 foot radius centered on the golem 
		- DC 18 Strength saving throw, full damage and displaced on a failed save, half damage and no displacement on a success
		- Combine [Gravity Sinkhole](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:gravity-sinkhole) (7d10) (39) force damage and facilitates the pull, and [Earth Tremor](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:earth-tremor) to knock prone
		- Creatures that fail are pulled directly next to the golem and knocked prone
		- Staggerable: The golem looses all resistance OR doesn't but regardless, if 50 damage is dealt to the golem is is staggered, and is stunned until the end of its next turn. This is a risk-reward attack. If the golem is staggered it looses its next turn and if it isn't the attack is devastating. 
	- Single Target Attack: Single target, +12 (26 Strength, CR 12, prof +4) to hit, (3d12) (19) + 8 bludgeoning damage + (6d6) (21) force damage. Conditional: if hit by lightning damage, next attack deals that lightning damage back to target. On a hit, releases a level 1 Magic Missile. On a hit, each creature in 15 foot radius of target makes DC 16 Dexterity save or take (1d12) + 8 bludgeoning damage as well. 
- *Magic Abilities*
	- Magic absorb: As a bonus action, the golem targets any creature, object, or magical effect within 10 feet of it. The golem chooses a spell already cast on the target. If the spell is of 3rd level or lower, the golem absorbs the spell and it ends. If the spell is of 4th level or higher, the golem must make a check with a +9 modifier. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the golem absorbs the spell and it ends. The golem’s body glows when it absorbs a spell, as if under the effect of a light spell. Can only hold one absorbed spell at a time.
	- Magic release: twin of magic absorb. The golem can release an absorbed spell effect as a blast of green energy, which blasts out as a sphere centered on the golem with a radius of 10 feet per level of the absorbed spell. All creatures in the area of effect other than the golem takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage per level of the absorbed spell, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw are also blinded until the end of the golem’s next turn
- *Rebuttal*
	- The Golem is shrouded with the magic of a [Fire Shield](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fire%20Shield#content) spell, set to warm shield. This deals (2d8) fire damage whenever the golem is hit with a melee attack.
	- I homebrew that this gives resistance to fire, not cold, damage. 
- *Inhibition*
	- The Golem, if it takes certain damage types, loses some of its powers. 
		- Thunder Damage: Slows the movement speed of the golem by 10 feet. This effect ends at the end of its next turn. This stacks. 
		- Acid Damage: Reduces magically enhanced AC of the golem and the base damage of the sword and 15 foot radius AoE of single target. 
		- Cold Damage: Freezes some runes. This deactivates *rebuttal* and the extra force damage / magic missiles that are apart of Single Target Attack
		- Lightning Damage: Heals the golem for the amount of damage taken and empowers its next Single Target Attack
		- *Resistances:* Fire, Force, Non-magical bludgeoning slashing piercing
		- *Immunities:* Lightning, Psychic, Poison
		- *Vulnerabilities:* Acid, Cold, Thunder
		- No condition immunities. 

This golem can be made much more powerful which translates to [[Silvan Gile]] improving on his original design. When it is improved, add more powerful attacks, less vulnerabilities and less weakness from those vulnerabilities as well as add condition immunities.
