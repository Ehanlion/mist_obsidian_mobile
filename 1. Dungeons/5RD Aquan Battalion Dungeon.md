**Description**
A small battalion of [[Aquan Nations]] soldiers are camped by the coast. Their seaweed tents and small hovels are submerged in the edges of large tide pools. Near them are a series of stone archways leading back into the cliff. You can see members of [[Aquan Nations]] occasionally entering and leaving from here. 

**Breakdown**, [[The 5 Room Dungeon]]
1. *Entrance*: 
	1. A small camp of Aquan nation troops blocks the entrance. They are camped near the tidepools on a large rock shelf on which the tidepools formed, and thus away from the base of the cliff. Occasionally, soldiers enter and leave the caves that are set a distance back from the main camp. 
	2. They see a priestess lounging in the tidepools, being attended to by a slew of Sahuaguin Brutes. 
	3. A DC 16 Perception check notes that soldiers entering the caves (and not leaving them) carry with them various chitinous creatures (lobster, clams, urchins). 
	4. Sneaking past the soldiers is easy, DC 14 Stealth check. 
	5. Attacking leads to a large scale battle that can visibly be ascertained to be extremely deadly. 
	6. However, exploring the campsite in silence could lead to discovery of some loot, or some information about the plans of [[Aquan Nations]] and [[Fedorov's Legion]]. 
	7. Moving past the entrance area requires entering the caves which snake back towards a large open room a ways back from the cliff. 
2. *Puzzle*: 
	1. There is a priestess and a couple other Brutes guarding the room at the back of the caves. These creatures attack on sight, but the fight is contained here because no one can hear.
	2. The priestess magically opens the door for the soldiers to enter and leave. They can force her to give up the secret, or solve the riddle themselves. 
	3. This riddle involves the chitinous creatures (lobster, clams, urchins) seen being carried in by the soldiers. 
	4. There is a large stone carving of a crab with a glowing gem in its forehead and a gaping maw, its carapace (made from stone) is completely clean but the surrounding ground is caked in blood, both fresh and dried. 
	5. With a DC 13 Arcana check, it can be ascertained that the gem requires a 3rd level spell to power. 
	6. With a DC 16 Nature/Perception check, you can see some small fragments of chitinous creatures (lobster, clams, urchins) in the open mouth of the crab. 
	7. With a DC 20 Investigation, you notice a ultra faint line in the far wall, roughly in a rectangular shape. 
	8. The solution is to kill 3 chitinous creatures (lobster, clams, urchins) and drain their blood onto the shrine, then eat them. Then a spell slot is expended to power the Gem (done by the priestess) and a hidden doorway opens at the rear of the cave.
3. *Setback*: 
	1. Here there is a large onslaught of very mundane Brutes of [[Aquan Nations]]. They should be styled in a [[Hordes Battle]] and easy to deal with.
	2. There are two main "Rooms," each is a large cavern. They are isolated with long stone passage ways. These passages fork off from the entrance of the secret puzzle room. One passage is closed and leads to the first group and the other is longer and leads towards another room. At the end of this hallway is a locked iron door. It is trapped (DC 13 Investigation) and (2d6) poison damage upon trying to open. DC 15 Slight of hand check to open with thieves tools. 
	3. There is a group of Sahuagin Brutes that appears to be creating something. They are doing brute labor of crushing up some poisonous jellyfish into an ooze. Then a priestess is magically enchanting this ooze in vials to create some noxious armament.  
	4. In a corner of this room is a metal cage with 3 prisoners in it. They look injured. They have scars on their body and look malnourished. These are miners from the compound. 
	5. With a DC 13 Nature/Survival check, their wounds are indicative of harm incurred by the Yellow Cap Killers
	6. With a DC 13 Perception check, bundled up harnesses and large fishing poles appear to be stacked nearby. They look recently used. 
	7. The Jellyfish being used are Yellow Cap Killers, the Jellyfish that create the Yellow Jellyfish Venom. 
	8. In the other room, plans are laid out on a table. A raid is being planned on a nearby town (Trawlrock, Schooner's End, or Herringshold). This raid will happen within the next week if this threat is not dealt with. They will use the enchanting ooze as a bioweapon and poison the townsfolks with deadly gas. 
	9. In the Planning room, players can learn of other attacks soon to happen at the southern towns. Movements of [[Aquan Nations]] troops are also drawn. In 4 weeks from today, troops will have moved from the West, at [[The Bay of Kelp]] and [[The Harmonious Sea]], east towards King Gillian's Channel and spreading along the northern and southern coasts of [[Whitecliff Plateau]]. 
	10. One member of [[Fedorov's Legion]] is in here working. He is surprised if you enter without triggering the trap on the door. He calls an absent-minded greeting to his friend as you enter before looking first shocked, and then fearful, and then combative. 
	11. This room is trapped:
		1. Touching any of the plans reveals a glyph of warding on the table, set to explode. DC 16 Investigation check to spot, DC 16 Dexterity save versus (5d8) acid damage
		2. If the acid damage triggers, the party has a finite amount of time to retrieve info before it is sullied. 
		3. Some of the plans are locked in an iron chest. It is trapped. DC 13 Investigation to spot, (2d6) poison damage is opened. DC 15 Slight of Hand check with thieves tools to open. This chest also has loot: 2 healing potions, a sack of gold, and an enchanted compass with label: "Compass to [[Karak-Ulgurath]]."
	12. There is a hidden passage way that leads away from this room. DC 14 Investigation Check to spot. Easily opens and leads to the Climax.
	13. The pathway leading here, and away from the secret entrance is trapped with a poison-stick fall trap. DC 12 Investigation spots the false section of flooring. DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, or fall in. (3d10) bludgeoning for falling 30 feet, (1d6) piercing for being impaled, and (3d6) poison damage for landing on the spikes. 
4. *Climax*:
	1. A passage way leads off from the planning room. This passage way is not guarded, but is well disguised. In this area are 1 member of [[Fedorov's Legion]] and a delegate from [[Followers of Alsolace]] and a crusader from [[Iron-fist Marauders]]. 
	2. They are here to lead the soldiers in their raid as well as inspire and plan their attack for them. 
	3. There is a tall shaft leading out of here, climbable via a long length of ladder. It leads to the top of the cliffs, nearly 120 feet above. The entrance is well hidden as a false section of ground on top of the cliff. 
	4. The crusader here wields a +2 Weapon. The delegate has 3 spell scrolls for a 3rd, 3rd, and 4th level spell and a [Mace of Disruption](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:mace-of-disruption). The Fedorov's member has a [Dragon Tooth Dagger](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:dragontooth-dagger) which he coats with poison before the fight and he has a vial of Wyvern Poison on him.  
5. *Resolution*: 
	1. They get to loot the dungeon.
	2. The twist is that there are more member of [[Fedorov's Legion]] and kin past the hidden pathway. 
	3. That should feel like a surprise.
