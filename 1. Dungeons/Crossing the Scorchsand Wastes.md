[[Crossing the Scorchsand Wastes]] lists the threats and encounters one could find traversing the [[Scorchsand Wastes]]. These wastes are devoid of life apart from hostile creatures and adventerous crossers. They must be crossed to reach the Northern parts of [[Mist]]. Due to their teacherous nature, they are a core reason between the North/South divide in [[Mist]]. 

# Death by Lack of Water
This region in [[Mist]] should be run as a massive survival challenge. Maintain water supplies. Find food to survive. Fend of attackers. Navigate brutal weather anomalies. Cross the wastes.

# Hostile Magic Detection
The creatures that live in the [[Scorchsand Wastes]] evolved to detect magic. Due to the sparse nature of prey, the ability to detect magic gives them an edge. 

**Detecting Magic:** A creature in the [[Scorchsand Wastes]] can detect any level of magic, excluding cantrips. The higher a level of a spell, the greater the odds of detection. A 9th level spell almost certaintly alerts all creatures near while a 1st level spell has the potential to go unnoticed.

Creating water with magic should feel dangerous and like a gamble. It should not feel free and easy to do:
- The primary threat of the [[Scorchsand Wastes]] is [[#Death by Lack of Water]] 
- Basic spells are able to generate drinking water, which should not be allowed. I want this to feel hostile and scary
