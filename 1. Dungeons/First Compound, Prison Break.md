# Goals
- Escape the compound with all 60 prisoners alive
- Navigate the halls of the compound to escape
- Give a clear list of choices that they can take to escape

# Ways to Escape
There are 3 main exits that are feasible:
1. **Exit through the Labyrinth** - shortest and easiest to reach, but possible deadliest with the Abberations/Undead here.
2. **Exit through the Original Secret Entrance** - medium length path and known list of rooms to traverse, known to be under watch by patrols. Can use secret, discovered rooms.
3. **Exit through Caves** - worst idea, they exit through cavern entrance in back of prison area. This leads to Sahuaguin caverns and almost certain death. The area is also unmapped for the group.
