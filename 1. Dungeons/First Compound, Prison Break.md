# Goals
- Escape the compound with all 60 prisoners alive
- Navigate the halls of the compound to escape
- Give a clear list of choices that they can take to escape
- Run a couple hallway fights on their path to escape

# What the Compound Knows
No member of [[The Aquan Nations]] escaped the prison chamber, but soon after they escape someone will see what has happened, likely **Aquavian** realizes what happened. He is smart and powerful, and will attempt to stop the party. 

The group has a random amount of time before the ruse is up. Roll a perception check for the Sahaguin every 15 minutes of IRL time and if it is good, they know. 

# Ways to Escape
There are 3 main exits that are feasible:
1. **Exit through the Labyrinth** - shortest and easiest to reach, but possible deadliest with the Abberations/Undead here.
2. **Exit through the Original Secret Entrance** - medium length path and known list of rooms to traverse, known to be under watch by patrols. Can use secret, discovered rooms.
3. **Exit through Caves** - worst idea, they exit through cavern entrance in back of prison area. This leads to Sahuaguin caverns and almost certain death. The area is also unmapped for the group. 

# How to Place Obstacles
For each time the group approachs a patrol location, get ready and roll a D20. Observere results below. These fights should feel fast paced and quick. If there is a fight, it should not take more than 20-30 minutes and don't have more than two fights. Moderate and Intern fights should resolve in 1-2 rounds tops.

| 16-20      | Interns    | Small group of Brutes and maybe a baron stand guard at an exit.                                           |
