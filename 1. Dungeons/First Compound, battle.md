**The High Priestess**
*I alluded to powerful, main priestess enemy that creatures of [[The Aquan Nations]] defer to.*

I think having this battle revolve around one very powerful caster could make it more interesting. Originally, I had wanted to run this as sort of a hard battle with lots of enemies. Instead, I think it would be more fun to have one primary enemy and like four or five lieutenants who support her. These lieutenants can act as the prisoner guard while the high priestess acts the primary enemy and controller of the compound.

Let's do the battle this way. The main enemy will be the high priest. She was alluded to throughout various dialogues in the dungeon so this makes sense. Supporting her will be her four lieutenants. These four lieutenants will consist of prisoner guards. They will use a mix of Marshall and magic abilities to subdue prisoners. The high priests will powerful but generic spells for a cleric or a similar caster. She should have her own layer actions. She should treat the prison as a lay. There should be extra very weak enemies present throughout the fight that can be killed with one hit point.

# The High Priestess
She is a natural leader and is **ordained by [[Karak-Ulgurath]]**. This means she has more powerful spellcasting and is regarded as a truth-sayer and revered one of the Stormlord, the chose deity of [[The Aquan Nations]].
