**The High Priestess**
*I alluded to powerful, main priestess enemy that creatures of [[The Aquan Nations]] defer to.*

I think having this battle revolve around one very powerful caster could make it more interesting. Originally, I had wanted to run this as sort of a hard battle with lots of enemies. Instead, I think it would be more fun to have one primary enemy and like four or five lieutenants who support her. These lieutenants can act as the prisoner guard while the high priestess acts the primary enemy and controller of the compound.

Let's do the battle this way. The main enemy will be the high priest. She was alluded to throughout various dialogues in the dungeon so this makes sense. Supporting her will be her four lieutenants. These four lieutenants will consist of prisoner guards. They will use a mix of Marshall and magic abilities to subdue prisoners. The high priests will powerful but generic spells for a cleric or a similar caster. She should have her own layer actions. She should treat the prison as a lay. There should be extra very weak enemies present throughout the fight that can be killed with one hit point.

# Prison Lair Gimmicks
1. **Warming Zones**: There are 3 warming zones in the prison, used to help warm the prisoners against the cold of the water that enters. A Warming Zone can clear all stacks of Frostburn on a creature as long as they end their turn within 10 feet of it. Warming Zones look like large dark-red rocks that radiate warmth. They are clearly visible. 

# Prison Lair Actions
The prison area is a powerful lair for [[#The High Priestess]]. She considers this area her lair. If she is killed, the lair effects immediately cease. Below are a list of lair actions the occur in order, starting on initiative count 20. 

**Magical Tide**: the water in the room swirls to the aid of the high priestess. Creatures the high priestess chooses within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure: (2d6) bludgeoning damage and are displaced 15 feet. Success: half damage. 

**Raise the Tide**: the water in the room increases. The water level in the room raises by 10 feet. The resting level of the tide is 30 feet. The room is 90 feet high. Then summon a [hunter shark](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hunter%20Shark#content).
