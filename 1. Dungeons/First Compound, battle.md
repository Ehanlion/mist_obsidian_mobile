**The High Priestess**
*I alluded to powerful, main priestess enemy that creatures of [[The Aquan Nations]] defer to.*

I think having this battle revolve around one very powerful caster could make it more interesting. Originally, I had wanted to run this as sort of a hard battle with lots of enemies. Instead, I think it would be more fun to have one primary enemy and like four or five lieutenants who support her. These lieutenants can act as the prisoner guard while the high priestess acts the primary enemy and controller of the compound.

Let's do the battle this way. The main enemy will be the high priest. She was alluded to throughout various dialogues in the dungeon so this makes sense. Supporting her will be her four lieutenants. These four lieutenants will consist of prisoner guards. They will use a mix of Marshall and magic abilities to subdue prisoners. The high priests will powerful but generic spells for a cleric or a similar caster. She should have her own layer actions. She should treat the prison as a lay. There should be extra very weak enemies present throughout the fight that can be killed with one hit point.

# List of Enemies
- **Primary Foe:** 1x [[#The High Priestess]]
- **Secondary Foes:** 3x [[#Aquan Prison Tenders]]
- **Brutes:** 6x Sahuaguin Brutes (weaker, let these die in one hit but have more come in during the fight) These are easy to kill but numerous. *Describe them as being weaker, fresher recruits.*
## Freeing Allies
There are 60 miners in the prison area. All 60 will be in their cages when the fight starts. A cage can be destroyed (Metal Object, AC 17) or opened instead. 

Only 6 miners naturally have a swimming speed. The others do not. If the group rallies them these 6 will fight alongside the group. Treat them as basic commoners with low hit points and unarmed attacks, unless the becomed armed. All are proficienct in martial weapons.

# Prison Lair Gimmicks
###### Warming Zones
There are 3 warming zones in the prison, used to help warm the prisoners against the cold of the water that enters. A Warming Zone can clear all stacks of Frostburn on a creature as long as they end their turn within the range of it. Warming Zones look like large dark-red rocks that radiate warmth. They are clearly visible. 
###### Healing Springs
There are two healing springs in the room, on opposite ends of the chamber. They are fizzly, bubbly pits that have weak healing properties. If water level rises over them, then their magic extends to a bubble column that rises from the spring to the surface of the water. If you end your turn in one of these springs, you regain (2d6) hit points.

# Prison Lair Actions
The prison area is a powerful lair for [[#The High Priestess]]. She considers this area her lair. If she is killed, the lair effects immediately cease. Below are a list of lair actions the occur in order, starting on initiative count 20. 

**Magical Tide**: the water in the room swirls to the aid of the high priestess. Creatures the high priestess chooses within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw. Failure: (2d6) bludgeoning damage and are displaced 15 feet. Success: half damage. 

**Raise the Tide**: the water in the room increases. The water level in the room raises by 10 feet. The resting level of the tide is 30 feet. The room is 90 feet high. Then summon a [hunter shark](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hunter%20Shark#content). The hunter shark is weak and it dies in one hit. 

**Backup!** A new pack of Sahuaguin Brutes enter the room. The brutes die in 1 hit. Describe them as fresh recruits who look weaker but determined to answer [[#The High Priestess]]. They make only one attack per turn. These recruits flee if [[#The High Priestess]] is killed. They are here because more experience soldiers have been called back for aggressive raids happening soon. 

*Included the statblock for the normal Sahuaguin brute right here.*

# The High Priestess
She is a natural leader and is **ordained by [[Karak-Ulgurath]]**. This means she has more powerful spellcasting and is regarded as a truth-sayer and revered one of the Stormlord, the chose deity of [[The Aquan Nations]]. She is a natural leader, fearsome warrior, and masterful spellcaster. There are more, but they are rare. Priestesses are the natural leaders in the Sahuaguin Society, thus her role as leader makes logical sense.

# Aquan Prison Tenders

- [[Glaive of Subduction]], a powerful glaive used by the prisoner tenders to subdue and control the prisoners. It has the power to cast controlling spells to ensnare prisoners.
