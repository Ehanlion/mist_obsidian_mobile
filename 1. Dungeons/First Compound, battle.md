**The High Priestess**
*I alluded to powerful, main priestess enemy that creatures of [[The Aquan Nations]] defer to.*

I think having this battle revolve around one very powerful caster could make it more interesting. Originally, I had wanted to run this as sort of a hard battle with lots of enemies. Instead, I think it would be more fun to have one primary enemy and like four or five lieutenants who support her. These lieutenants can act as the prisoner guard while the high priestess acts the primary enemy and controller of the compound.
