[[Remember, a Shera Dungeon]] is an adaptation from a S3E5 of Shera. I really like the notion of an episode where *something dramatic happens* and causes a flashback like event. In the episode, Adora, after the portal is activated, starts to relive a past life while slowly realizing things are going wrong. 

A character begins to relive a normal feeling period of their life after a world-changing event. A growing sense of fear and confusion should begin to fill the player.
# How it Works
- Dramatic, world altering event, maybe something to do with time or the world ending
- Then cut to black
- Character is living in a past version of their life. Everything there seems normal and reasonable. Play into the charcter's ideals and safe things
- We want the character to feel like they *want to stay* in the past vision
- Slowly begin to describe things that are wrong, but very slowly
- There should be an initial feeling of confusing, then comfort, then fear that something terrible is happening that the character does not see
- They have to find *something* in the past vision, something that is important to the event that they feel could disrupt events
