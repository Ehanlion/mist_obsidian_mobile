Located in the [[Frigid Crucible]], [[The Deep Labyrinth]] is the dungeon formed from the death of one of [[The Many]]. Who, I am not sure yet. The most important part is that, at its center, resides one of the Shards.

The Labyrinth is designed to be ultra-confusing. Its passages change and alter with time. If the party manages to long rest, then their entire path will be corrupted. Navigating [[The Deep Labyrinth]] requires knowing a series of Left-Right-Straight codes that are hidden in the entrance room. At any point, if the group follows a correct combination they can end up somewhere important.

## Navigating
Later we have places like **The Engine**, **The Forge**, and **The Heart**. For **The Heart,** this path with be derived from *the name of the member this dungeon is for*. But I have not decided this. The other two are directly from their names.
- Each passage in the dungeon is a long snaking tunnel and at the end there are **three paths**
- Middle is *always* a the BREAK character between morse code segments
	- In Morse code to transmit two letters, there is a slight pause between them
	- Go down the middle path *between* encoded letters
- Left is *always* DOT
- Right is *always* DASH
- We use *morse code* to encode the names. 
- Encode the names as follows:
	- Engine: `. -. --. .. -. .` = `LMRLMRRLMLLMRLMLM`
	- Forge: `..-. --- .-. --. .` = `LLRLMRRRMLRLMRRLMLM`
	- The final character is always `M` and when they get the rest correct, the final `M` they take is the only path, the other two are always caved in or blocked
	- Then the middle path leads directly to the location

### Changing Navigation Schemes
Switching navigation scheme for each place:
- I think it would be really easy to just do the next location having solved the first
- So maybe it is better to have the Engine, Forge, and "Heart" rooms be different methods to getting there?
- I don't like just inverting the passages and their morse code mappings (like Left goes from Dot to Dash once the first puzzle is complete then vice versa for the Right)

### Final, Important Notes on Navigation
Super important note about navigating:
- If they make a mistake it restarts
- There is ALWAYS a L, R, M option in a tunnel
- It does not matter where they start in the dungeon
- Think of it as the correct "key" is a "substring" in the overall "string" of L,R,Ms they have taken
- We only care if the "key substring" exists in the path the took. 
- They have to take the correct turns, in order, no backtracking, in one go, or they have not solved the puzzle yet.

## Enemy List
The enemies in the dungeon are dark, evil creatures:
1. **The Skitterlings**, intelligent, bat-like goblin creatures who use tools and work in groups to poach sacrifices for what they call "Their Heart." (The Shard)
2. **The Dark Lizards**, blind lizards with perfect hearing, their high perception makes them excellent hunters even without vision
3. **The Gopes**, trickster creatures, much like an angler fish, that bait predators with a psudeopod lure appendage
4. **The Glisters**, abberation style enemies that consume and feed off of eyes 

### Moving Creatures
Creatures navigate blindly through the dungeon. Skitterlings, being intelligent, still do not understand the way to their hideout. They hideout is the Engine room and their "Heart" is the magic inhibitor here. They know how to navigate here but not *why* their navigation works. Most of them spend days trying to figure their way back. 

### Random Encounters
Enemy encounters need to be frequent, but not super deadly. The group should feel like the dungeon is dangerous. Punish long and shorts rests with random encounters, ideally, 1 of every 4 long rest attempts succeeds:
- **During the "Day"**
	- While walking around, roll `4 D20`. For each roll above 13, there is a random enemy encounter
	- If there is an encounter, roll a `D4` or just chose an enemy, and this is the encounter
		- Dark Lizards hunt, to avoid them requires stealth
		- Skitterlings ambush, to avoid them requires good perception and searching
		- Gopes bait their prey, to avoid them use nature or survival to spot the deception
		- Glisters are just deadly, their is no avoiding these, if you encounter one, it will try to kill you so you have to fight
- **Long/Short Resting**
	- When trying to rest, try to be aggresive with encounters on the party
	- For a long rest, roll a `D20 per watch`, minimum 3 rolls, each roll corresponds to a watch. If the roll is above 13, there is a random enemy encounter
		- Use passive perception of creature on watch as the benchmark for the party getting ambushed or not.
		- If an encounter happens, roll the same `D4` except two of the numbers correspond to Skitterlings and we ignore Gopes. (Skitterlings are assasains, they wait till party is incapacitated to strike)
	- For a short rest, roll  a `2 D20`. If the roll is above 13, there is a random enemy encounter
		- Use the best passive perception in the party as the benchmark for the party getting ambushed or not.
		- If an encounter happens, roll the same `D4` except two of the numbers correspond to Dark Lizards and we ignore Gopes. (Dark lizards are prowlers, it makes more sense for one to randomly stumble on the party resting than other creatures)

## Dungeon Room Breakdown
Important rooms in the dungeon, these are areas that are left over from the member of [[The Many]] who used this place as their workshop. This member was a powerful Artificer and forged items for the rest of [[The Many]], including the Shards.
1. The Engine, generates magical power for the labyrinth and powers the magic inhibitor that stops powerful magic in the dungeon. 
	- The engine was once a normal monument of great wonder, however it was corrupted by years of the skitterlings making sacrifices to it
	- The monument is covered in caked-on blood, fragments of thousands of bones, and an unending variety of trinkets
2. The Forge, a magical super-forge capable of feats of wonder if used correctly
	- Was once used to forge The Shards here
	- Contained in a small library here are detailed plans of each shard and who they were made for as well, including each member's class
	- There are also other plans detailed here, such as The Aetherveil Projector and The Mist Codex, powerful projects of [[The Many]]
3. The Vault, the hidden "Heart" of the dungeon, where the Shard is kept.
	- This area is a small place, hidden from the rest of the dungeon and much like a time capsule.
	- This is where the member of [[The Many]] died and the area was created upon their death, crafting the Labyrinth as protection against their secrets

These locations are magically concealled and, even if someone follows the correct path to one of them, they must be visited in order first.
