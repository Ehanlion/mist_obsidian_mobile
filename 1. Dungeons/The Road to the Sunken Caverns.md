*This dungeon outlines the trials of the party travelling from [[Trawlrock]] to the [[Sunken Caverns]], possibly past [[Herringshold]]. While this part of the journey is not a classic dungeon, we can treat the progression as a psuedo-instance of [[The 5 Room Dungeon]]*. 

**Breakdown**
1. Entrance: Leaving [[Trawlrock]] and heading out along the [[Whitecliff]] byway.
2. Puzzle: How to avoid the repeated Sahuaguin raids along the coastal road.
3. Setback: They see a larger attack on [[Herringshold]] and have to either intervene or avoid.
4. Climax: Reaching a vista overlooking the [[Sunken Caverns]]
5. Resolution: Having the info about basic threats of the [[Sunken Caverns]] as well as a vision/idea of where [[Vivian Lovejoy]] and [[Karak-Ulgurath]] both are.
