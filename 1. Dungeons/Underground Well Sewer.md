The [[Underground Well Sewer]] dungeon was inspired by a conversation with a work employee. I like the notion of a well, jumping into the well, swimming through murk, and finding a passage being a lead-in to an ungerground sewer dungeon.

### Hooks
- Chase could lead here, a criminal could knowingly jump down the well
- Sickness in water, locals could be complaining about poinsoning in well (caused by leeching of sewers into well because a wall has been caved in my a monster)
