# Wild Magic Dungeon Description
![[IMG_8888.jpeg]]

This would be an arena where the main enemy is a dragon. The primary theme would be centred around wild magic. The fight would consist of a mechanical arena where interact Steuble pedestals, generate powerful round changing effects.

These effects should be generated randomly from random tables, but the players should be able to control whether or not they want to roll on these tables during the round
# Wild Magic Dragon
This combat is centered around a [[#Wild Magic Dragon]], which is half-mechanical creation and half-natural beast. The mechanical side originates from [[The Many]], who created this as a guardian.

**Spellcasting**:
The dragon could use randomly chosen spells. Create a deck of spells including an equal amount of every level, chosen from the wizard spell list. Everytime the dragon casts as an action, or as a Legendary Action, draw a card from the deck. This is the spell that it casts. Purely random and pure chaos.
