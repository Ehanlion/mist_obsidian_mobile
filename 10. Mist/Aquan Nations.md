[[Aquan Nations]] are the combined group of Sahuaguin, Merfolk, and Triton who are allied under the new Aspect of the Stormlord, [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. They are allied with [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[Iron-Fist Marauders]].
# Reason for Conquest
Some 500 years ago, King Gillian's Channel was constructed to connect [[Distant Sea]] and [[Harmonious Sea]] through [[Whitecliff Plateau]]. This effort was headed by the Miners of [[Whitecliff]] and the armies of [[Gandoria]]. Together, they spent 100 years constructing the channel.

During this time, a conquest was led against [[Aquan Nations]]. Since this new channel would divert ships, thus cutting off a hunting target of [[Aquan Nations]], the aquan's were engraged. Furthermore, the construction disrupted wildlife and the dumping of the stone into the sea corrupted the surrouding ocean seascape. At the time, large colonies of [[Aquan Nations]] lived near where the channel was being built, which fought back against this but were defeated by the might of [[Gandoria]]. 

Now, with the prophecy of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and the combined forces of [[Aquan Nations]], a new conquest shall transpire. [[Aquan Nations]], on the backs of the prophecy, have been ordained to conquer [[Whitecliff Plateau]] and [[Whitecliff]] as well as destroy [[Gandoras City]], toppling [[Seat of Stone]] and the [[Gandoria]] empire.
