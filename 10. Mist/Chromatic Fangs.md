[[Chromatic Fangs]] are the boundary mountains in [[Mist]] that divide the western reaches of the island from [[Stormlocked Frontier]]. The mountains themselves are divided into two sections: The northern reaches, called [[Frigid Crucible]], and the southern reaches, called [[Scorvorrian Peaks]]. The northern reaches are frozen and tall. The southern reaches are brutally hot and volcanic.
