**Active contracts:**
1. **Valyra**: contract for powers via the Umbr Cabal and their devils
2. **Deion**: simple contract with Yugo Stolid to give Yugo "one favor whenever he asks" or face his soul being lost.  

**Devil contracts**
- Devils inherit contracts of the lesser devils that they oversee.
- If a devil dies, their immediate superior chooses to uphold or dismiss an inherited contract. Most will seek to uphold contracts unless they have an outstanding reason not to.
- Contracts are always written in infernal, the language of Devils.

**Heirarchy**
- Yugo directly serves the Archdevil
- From *most important* to *least important*
	1. The Archdevil: [[Voramas]]
	2. Dukes: 
	3. Pit Fiends:
	4. Greater Devils:
	5. Lesser Devils:
	6. Least Devils:

**Using contracts for evil**
When this plan is enacted, the Archdevil kills Yugo, takes over his contracts, and forces Deion to kill his friends. Deion wil have a choice: obey and live, or refuse and face dire consequences. 

If a creature refuses to honour a contract they have a *enforcement clause* wherein the creature is transformed into a devil-spawn. A creature bound by a contract with an *enforcement clause* makes 3 charisma saves if they refuse to honor. 

**The saves for refusal**
1. DC 14 Charisma 
2. DC 21 Charisma
3. DC 28 Charisma

 On failure, the creature is transformed into a devil spawn, barbed devils, barlgura, or even Abashai.
