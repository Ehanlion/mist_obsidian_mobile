[[Fedorov's Legion]] is the evil pirate faction that contests rulership of [[Hope Town]]. They are led by the cruel pirate king of [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and his right hand man, the archmage [[Silvan Gile]]. Their expertise in manipulation, killing, magic, and profit has led [[Fedorov's Legion]] to be the most powerful and most formidable faction in [[Hope Town]], one that [[Deadtide Reapers]] won't stand up to, and one that [[Blue Coat Brigade]] can only try to contest.
