[[Fractured Coast]] is the arid coast that lies on the southern coast of [[Mist]]. It has no connection to northern parts of [[Mist]], forcing the residents (when necessary) to brave the hot expanses of the [[Scorchsand Wastes]]. The coast itself is modelled off of my knoweldge of empires rules by Sultans. I feel like if Turkey was a fantasy setting, this coast would be visually modelled off of it to some extent.
