[[Gandoria]] is the nation whose center is [[Gandoras City]]. Its ruling throne is [[Seat of Stone]]. 

People of [[Gandoria]] are called Gandorians.

[[Gandoria]] has about 200,000 people in its nation. They tightly inhabit the area bordered to the West by King Gillian's Channel, to the North by [[Distant Sea]], to the south by Lake Middle Mist and [[Discordant Plains]], and to the East by [[Greenheart Wilderness]]. 

This area has dense suburbs and towns, large clusterings of farming encampments (that use magic to farm), and abundant infrastructure to promote quick navigation and transport. It is more "modern" than the neighboring Fiefdom of [[Whitecliff]].
