[[Gandoria]] is the official name of the nation of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. Its center is [[Gandoras City]]. Its ruling throne is [[The Seat of Stone]]. 

People of [[Gandoria]] are called Gandorians.

[[Gandoria]] has about 150,000 people in its nation. About 50,000 live along the actual [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] while close to 100,000 live in and around [[Gandoras City]]. Although when I say [[Gandoras City]], I more mean the surrounding 10-15 miles or so. People inhabit up and down King Gillian's Channel, on either side, and all around the white walls of [[Gandoras City]] itself.
