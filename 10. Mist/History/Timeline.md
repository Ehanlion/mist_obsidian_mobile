| Era Name                 | Description of Era                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Mist | Mist | Planes | Planes |

| The Lost Times           | History that is forgotten due to [[The Great Mind Blank]]. These times were highly tribal, creatures were not unified, and thus history went mostly undocumented, so not much physical history was lost.                                                                                                                                   | 1218 | 1624 | 1218   | 1624   |
| The Architects           | A brief Era where [[The Many]] came to [[Mist]]. In this short time they evolved the local creatures, they terraformed [[Mist]], and they created their super-structures for defense.                                                                                                                                                      | 1600 | 1624 | 1600   | 1624   |
| [[The Great Mind Blank]] | This event was the tipping point. [[The Many]] activated a device that wiped the memory of all those on [[Mist]] as a last resort.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 1625 | 1625 | 1625   | 1625   |
| The Chaos                | A turbulent time because people lost themselves in the blanking. Here a dissent for magic arose as people blamed Magic for lost memories. Heretics turned to statues of unknown Gods for guidance.                                                                                                                                         | 1    | 103  | 1625   | 1727   |
| The Founding             | An era of regrowth and rebuilding to establish cities and civilizations. The earliest factions valued martial fighters over magic casters. Divine magic was consided to be dirty and mysterious. Mages and diviners were extremely rare.                                                                                                   | 104  | 444  | 1728   | 2068   |
| The Dark Wars            | An era of power struggles and wars between the largest factions on [[Mist]]. These wars were fought in martial style, as Magic was viewed as taboo. They were bloody and reduced the population size of [[Mist]] by over half.                                                                                                             | 445  | 550  | 2069   | 2174   |
| The Magical Renaissance  | Magic was finally used as a last resort. Those who practiced in secret became heroes. It was used for growing crops, creating clean water, and cleaning the land after wars. The surges of mages and casters led to a revolution of how Magic was viewd and used. Diviners provided new view points on faith and fate and became accepted. | 551  | 1201 | 2175   | 2825   |
| The Gilded Years         | These years finally saw stability as magic became commonplace, diviners brought words from the Gods they followed, and martials maintained reasonable militia. A general peace was founded across the lands and these times are regarded as the first stable times in [[Mist]]'s storied history.                                          | 1202 | 1510 | 2826   | 3133   |
The years in [[Mist]] are not the same as those across the Wider Planes. Since [[The Great Mind Blank]], the years reset in [[Mist]]. There will be a **Large difference in referenced dates** between the Monuments of [[The Many]] and the histories of [[Mist]] after [[The Great Mind Blank]].
