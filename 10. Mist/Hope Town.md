[[Hope Town]] is the jewel of [[The Stormlocked Frontier]]. It is a town where control is constantly in flux between three pirate factions: [[Fedorov's Legion]], [[The Blue Coat Brigade]], and [[The Deadtide Reapers]]. Together, the three factions dominate most of the town in street-to-street gang-style warfare. The town itself is a seedy coalition of pirates, corairs, bandits, and criminals that all created a town as a haven with the "hope" of starting anew. It is located on the Northern end of the coast of [[The Stormlocked Frontier]].
