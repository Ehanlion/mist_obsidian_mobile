[[The Woman of the Woods]] can be a really interesting "god" figure. She exists as a Patron in the [[Greenheart Wilderness]]. She appears as a spectral woman of wispy, silky clothes and with a quiet but poweful voice. She is revered and respected, but also feared. She does not distinguish between evil and good when choosing heroes. 

### Connection to [[The Many]]
I like the notion that [[The Woman of the Woods]] is either an actual member of [[The Many]], namely a druid, that died in the [[Greenheart Wilderness]] and slowly went mad and melded with the forest OR she is an afterimage of a *the Shards* that [[The Many]] created. 

Whatever it is, I like the "heart" of [[The Woman of the Woods]] to be somewhere deep in the [[Greenheart Wilderness]], well protected and sequestered away. Maybe something like an ancient city or a site of ruins, relating to a monument of [[The Many]]. That would make the most thematical sense.
