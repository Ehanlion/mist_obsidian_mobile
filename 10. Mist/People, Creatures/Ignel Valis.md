[[Ignel Valis]] was a power Wizard Mage whose storied travels comprise the well loved tales of "The Greatest of the Great." This series of works, styled as journal entries, tell the tale of [[Ignel Valis]]' life, even the adventure on which he ultimately died. This final tale was written in his memory by a "close friend" (who in actuality, was the duo of [[Garrick Blackthorn]] and [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] working together to help him). In his travels, [[Ignel Valis]] was praised for his pursuit of the unknown and the mysterious as well as his unmatched prowess in Wizard combat. His unmatched talents were only matched by ever-growing demands of those who read his works, a development that lead to an unhealthy growth of his ego and a deterioration of his personality. As this happened, he felt more and more angry and betrayed that "his next great thing" was never great enough for his fans. Whether or not this was true is up for grabs; it could be internal, it could be real. Regardless, his crashout resulted in his untimely death while facing an Ancient Black Dragon in [[The Greenheart Wilderness]]. HIs body was never recovered.
