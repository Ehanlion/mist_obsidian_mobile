[[Karak-Ulgurath]] is the aspect of The Stormlord. Its arrival is considered prophecy by [[Aquan Nations]] and was organized by [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Silvan Gile]]. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] takes the form of a Colossal crab with a gemstone embedded in its carapace. 

**A Spoken Emissary:**
[[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s prophecy, granted to [[Aquan Nations]] as their lore foretold, was made up by [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Silvan Gile]]. This prophecy falsely guides [[Aquan Nations]], [[Karak-Ulgurath]] or no [[Karak-Ulgurath]], to conquer [[Whitecliff Plateau]]. In the prophecy it is told that if [[Karak-Ulgurath]] lives, the conquest will be short and sweet, but if it does not, it foretells a brutal conquest that must still be completed to save [[Aquan Nations]].
