[[Scintillating Order]] is the great order of mages and wise ones from [[Runewilds]]. Their leader was referenced as "The Queen" and was killed by [[The Many]] to escape the servitude that they were unwillingly placed into. 

This murder forever invoked the ire of not only [[Scintillating Order]] but all of [[Runewilds]] as [[The Many]] are framed as evil killers to be hunted at all costs. To this day, only the greater structures of [[The Many]] stand in defense of the pursuit and hunt of [[Scintillating Order]]. 

# The Order and the Mind Blank
[[Scintillating Order]], on the day when [[The Great Mind Blank]] occured, had members fighting in [[Mist]]. It also had spys that had infiltrated [[Mist]] (before [[The Many]] created and operated their super structures). These creatures had their minds blanked during [[The Great Mind Blank]] and became apart of the native beings of [[Mist]].
