The [[Scorchsand Wastes]] has a special, region-wide effect. The sands of the Desert amplify the castings of spells and the usage of enchanted, magical items. Not only that, but the creatures that inhabit the desert have evolved to smell and detect magic that is casted near them.
## The Resonance
**Rumors:**
These are popular rumors that are told across the [[Fractured Coast]] and the [[Scorchsand Wastes]]. There are elements of truth in each.
- Some say an ancient creature, buried in the sand can see all magic in the desert and tells the creatures of the sands the origins as retribution for a long ago act that killed it.
- Some say the desert is like a massive web, where magic is like plucking a thread on the web and more powerful effects are like larger things getting caught in the web.
- Some say the sands themselves resonate and transfer the hum of magic across the desert and that the creatures can hear this resonance across the sands. 
- Some say the magic is like music that carries across the deserts and that creatures long ago were akin to music and can hear the weave singing across the sands. 

I do not know the true nature of the [[Scorchsand Wastes - Resonance]], in a way each of these rumors are true. There is potential to tie this to [[The Many]] as some warning/detection system for threats. This could lead to a hideout with some device/monument powering this effect. 

**The Resonant Eye**
The following can trigger the "resonance"
1. Casting spells (excluding cantrips)
2. Triggering/Using magical effects
3. Using (or using the ability of) a magic item

**Some notes I had:**
- Casting spells should feel risky!
- The Desert is aimed as a survival challenge, made most difficult by getting water (this is easy with spells hence this effect)
- Casting any spells should trigger this effect, but lesser spells should have a lesser chance!
- Attunement to magic items doesn't trigger the effect
- Using a magic item in any capacity does trigger the effect (as simple as swinging a +1 sword)
- If the effect is *not* a spell the item casts, the chance of triggering the resonance is dependant on the rarity of the item (higher rarity, higher chance)
- If the effect *is* a spell the item casts, then treat this as a normal spell cast

**Table of Triggerings**
If the resonance is triggered, the creature rolls a single $D20$ and the GM consults the table below to determine the result that occurs. **Still needs work!**

| Spell Level | Item Rarity | Lesser DC | Greater DC | Ultra DC |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Cantrip     | *Mundane*   | N/a       | N/a        | N/a      |
| Level 1     | *Common*    | 13        | 18         | 20       |
| Level 2     | *Common*    | 12        | 17         | 20       |
| Level 3     | *Uncommon*  | 11        | 16         | 20       |
| Level 4     | *Uncommon*  | 10        | 15         | 20       |
| Level 5     | *Rare*      | 9         | 14         | 19       |
| Level 6     | *Rare*      | 7         | 12         | 18       |
| Level 7     | *Very Rare* | 5         | 10         | 17       |
| Level 8     | *Very Rare* | 3         | 8          | 16       |
| Level 9     | *Legendary* | 1         | 6          | 15       |
Effects descriptions:
- Lesser effects should be minor setbacks and small encounters
- Greater effects should be fearful fights
- Ultra effects should be annihilation and terror 
- Unsure on how to do tables, maybe a d10 or something? Create these later. 
## [[Scorchsand Wastes]] Creature Evolution
The creatures of the waste are naturally attuned to the [[Scorchsand Wastes]] and the [[Scorchsand Wastes - Resonance]] from ages of evolution. Creatures that mock and mimic the creatures of the sands can learn this ability.

**Creatures of the Sands**
A creature can "hear" (or generally detect) the usage of magic within a massive radius of themselves. Spells, magical effects, and magic items (being used, not held) all can be heard by creatures in the deserts.
