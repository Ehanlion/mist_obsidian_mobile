The [[Scorchsand Wastes]] are the vast, hostile deserts that make up the center of the South of [[Mist]]. They are to the West of the [[Scorvorrian Peaks]]. They are brutal, eternally hot, and it never rains. They are wrought with evil magic and are deeply hostile to crossings. The creatures that dwell here are diverse; a range of creatures from the smallest swarms of desert crawlers up to the titanic sand worms that can shift entire sandscapes. 

The [[Scorchsand Wastes]] have an effect that resonates the usage of magic and magic items across the sands, allowing native creatures to hear it. This is called: [[Scorchsand Wastes - Resonance]]! It is a deterrant to using magic and the enabler (mechanic wise) for a survival-style campaign.
