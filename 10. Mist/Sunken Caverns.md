[[Sunken Caverns]] is the South-Eastern sea cave on [[Whitecliff Plateau]]. It is the deepest, darkest, and most feared of the sea caves here. Its waters are said to hold horrors of the deeps.

[[Karak-Ulgurath]] and [[Aquan Nations]] have a main base here where the Librarians are being kept, e.g. where [[Vivian Lovejoy]] is being held prisoner.
