[[The Whitecliff Plateau]] is the north-western region of mist, spanning the vast outcropping of land jutting out into both [[The Harmonious Sea]] (to the west) and [[The Distant Sea]] (to the north). It is a sleepy region, but one riddle with conflict and aggression as [[The Aquan Nations]] lead a conquest in the name of [[Karak-Ulgurath]] against these lands. Minus the combat, the region is raised above the far seas upon a shoreline of massive, tall, white cliffs; these are the namesake of the region. It is ruled over by [[Gandoras City]] and [[The Seat of Stone]]. [[The Seat of Stone]] has ruled over the region for the know history of [[Mist]] (and actually before, but this is secret lore). [[Gandoras City]] is the gemstone of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]], a massive city of white walls, it is a bastion overseeing the region.
