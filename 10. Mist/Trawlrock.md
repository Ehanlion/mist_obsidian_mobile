## Things to do
All tasks relate to the following: the [[Aquan Nations]] realize that Trawlrock is walled and hard to break into, so they have put forward groups hidden around time to give them advantage. If they do NOT help with these tasks, then Trawlrock might get blindsided by invading Aqaun folks inside the town. 
1. Help the Saltstone brewery fix its brew system because ale is going bad
	- The brewery connects to caves that go all the way down to sea level. They age and store product here. 
	- This would lead the party to the brewery with the brewing vats
	- The problem is that there are giant crabs hidden in the brewing vats, put there by [[Aquan Nations]].
	- There are also signs hidden through the brewery, like a broken dead barnacle, fragments of shell, footsteps etc. 
2. Find someone's lost pet in the whispering Aqueduct.
	- This can be like the town's pet or something, call him Salty or Boris or something
	- Pet ran off and hid in the aqueduct and cannot be found
	- The aqueduct is outside town and spans over crevasses into the sea
	- They can track the pet here by tracks left, but there are other tracks of [[Aquan Nations]] left here as a clue as well
	- They can find the pet about to be eaten by the creatures hiding here and they have to save it. 
3. Help the Tidesage Chapel with a ghost in their caverns. 
	- Sages here make treacherous hike down steep cave walls to frothing sea beneath to read waves for omens to predict the town's future
	- Recently, some have gone missing and sages have found blood and bones
	- Sages rumored to have seen blue eyes and strange, unwordly magic, as well as a potent sign of magic from the sage's god, the Stormlord
	- Group must investigate here and search for missing sages
	- There are aquan priests here and brutes hidden underwater in the caves lurking
