### Description
[[Trawlrock]] is one of the clifftop towns that ring the [[Whitecliff Plateau]]. [[Trawlrock]] is the only walled town and has the second largest population, behind Gullhook. [[Trawlrock]] is stout and squat with most buildings being hewn from rough-cut, white rock and stone. The local fishermen have docks down at the sea with docked boats and hoist shafts with cages that lift fishermen and catch up and down from the docks. 

[[Trawlrock]] has a population of about 5-7 thousand. It has a posted militia of about 500 citizens. They are moderately armed and train on the grounds outside the town.

## Things to do
All tasks relate to the following: the [[Aquan Nations]] realize that Trawlrock is walled and hard to break into, so they have put forward groups hidden around time to give them advantage. If they do NOT help with these tasks, then Trawlrock might get blindsided by invading Aqaun folks inside the town. 
1. Help the Saltstone brewery fix its brew system because ale is going bad
	- The brewery connects to caves that go all the way down to sea level. They age and store product here. 
	- This would lead the party to the brewery with the brewing vats
	- The problem is that there are giant crabs hidden in the brewing vats, put there by [[Aquan Nations]].
	- There are also signs hidden through the brewery, like a broken dead barnacle, fragments of shell, footsteps etc. 
2. Find someone's lost pet in the whispering Aqueduct.
	- This can be like the town's pet or something, call him Salty or Boris or something
	- Pet ran off and hid in the aqueduct and cannot be found
	- The aqueduct is outside town and spans over crevasses into the sea
	- They can track the pet here by tracks left, but there are other tracks of [[Aquan Nations]] left here as a clue as well
	- They can find the pet about to be eaten by the creatures hiding here and they have to save it. 
3. Help the Tidesage Chapel with a ghost in their caverns. 
	- Sages here make treacherous hike down steep cave walls to frothing sea beneath to read waves for omens to predict the town's future
	- Recently, some have gone missing and sages have found blood and bones
	- Sages rumored to have seen blue eyes and strange, unwordly magic, as well as a potent sign of magic from the sage's god, the Stormlord
	- Group must investigate here and search for missing sages
	- There are aquan priests here and brutes hidden underwater in the caves lurking
## Mini‑quest 1 – Saltstone Brewery sabotage

**Hook & setup.** The Saltstone Brewery’s briny pale ales have turned sour and the brewers beg the PCs for help. The brewery is carved into the cliff and its fermentation caves descend to sea level[GitHub](https://github.com/Ehanlion/mist_obsidian_mobile/blob/daefa6e4462b04c83f5bfb00d800586ce1dca399/10.%20Mist/Trawlrock.md#L32-L35). This subterranean complex is where the party first encounters **giant crabs**—medium beasts that can breathe air and water and attack with claws that grapple their targets[roll20.net](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Giant%20Crab#:~:text=Amphibious%3A%20The%20crab%20can%20breathe,air%20and%20water).

**Scenes & obstacles.**
- **Investigation.** In the upper brewery, characters can question **Daelin Netscar** (head brewer) and examine vats. Perception or Investigation checks (DC 12–14) reveal fragments of shell, broken barnacles and briny footprints
- **Cavern descent.** Narrow, slippery stairs lead down into storage tunnels; failed Dexterity checks could send PCs sliding into fermenting pools or drop them onto catwalks above the sea.
- **Ambush.** Hidden in the vats are **giant crabs** placed there by Aquan agents. Many Sahuaguin lurk here waiting to ambush the town. 
- **Clues & payoff.** Beyond the fermentation cave, a narrow sea tunnel hides crates of seaweed ropes and a hidden passage containing a small room with a rough description of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s lair area and the Prisoner areas here too. Returning the brewery to working order wins the party the town’s gratitude and hints at the Aquan plan to poison the town’s ale with jellyfish toxins discovered in the Aquan battalion dungeon.

## Mini‑quest 2 – Lost pet in the Whispering Aqueduct

**Hook & setup.** A distraught child or the mayor approaches the PCs: the town’s beloved Baby White Dragon “Salty” has gone missing in the Whispering Aqueduct. The aqueduct is an exposed channel spanning a deep crevasse outside the walls; locals whisper about strange footprints near the waterworks.

**Scenes & obstacles.**
- **Tracking.** Survival checks follow the pet’s muddy paw prints along the aqueduct and reveal webbed prints and scales belonging to Aquan agents. Sections of the aqueduct have missing flagstones; characters must make Acrobatics checks to cross narrow ledges or risk falling into the chasm.
- **Encounter.** Near a broken sluice gate, the party hears distress squeaks. Some Sahuaguin Brutes are attempting to kill the pet. The creatures guard jars of **yellow jellyfish venom** that would have been poured into the water supply. PCs must rescue the pet, defeat or drive off the raiders and disarm the sabotage.
- **Clues & payoff.** Searching the site uncovers a coded note mentioning a “three‑day moon” when a hidden force will strike from the Bay of Kelp. The recovered pet becomes a local hero, and the PCs earn the affection of **Mayor Mara Saltreef**; more importantly, they learn that the aqueduct was a target to weaken the town before the assault.

## Mini‑quest 3 – The Tidesage Chapel haunting

**Hook & setup.** The Tidesage Chapel is built into caverns beneath the cliff; sages descend steep cave walls to read omens in the surf. Recently, two sages went missing; another returned babbling about blue eyes and unworldly magic. The head priest begs the PCs to investigate.

Description I had: The entrance grotto leads down to a rift in the earth. Vertical, tall walls have stairs and passages carved in them that leads down to the sea beneath. They are slick and the rumble of the sea rolling in is always apparent. At the bottom is a dais on a rocky bridge spanning the gap. It is constantly being washed over by waves. This dais grants a view of the sea (where the sages originally saw [[Karak-Ulgurath]] passing). 

The Ghost, if used, talks with the players. However, when combat starts it (with remorse) turns against the players. The Sahuaguin Priestess has the body trapped in a bubble underwater and is using it for strength. Freeing the body breaks the tie and the Ghost will help the party until it fades. 

**Scenes & obstacles.**
- **Descent & investigation.** Climbing down to the chapel’s lower caverns requires Athletics checks. Inside, PCs find blood spatters and broken prayer beads. Religion checks can calm nervous Tidesage initiates and glean information about the Stormlord’s omens.
- **The ghost.** In the deepest grotto floats the spirit of a drowned Tidesage. Use a ghost stat block. The ghost moves through walls. The Ghost was killed and the body captured before the Ghost could pass on to the next world. If the party helps it in its passage, it grants them a vision of [[Vivian Lovejoy]]
- **Aquan ambush.** The **sahuagin priests** and **brutes** emerge from underwater pools to attack. These priests carry blue coral holy symbols tied to Karak‑Ulgurath and notes detailing when reinforcements from Fedorov’s Legion will arrive.
- **Clues & payoff.** The missing sages bodies may be found in an underwater cave, visible if the party jumps in the water to help free the ghost. If they bring the bodies back to the sages, they perform a ritual and give the players a small reward. (e.g., a **driftwood talisman that grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks near the sea**) and a prophecy pointing toward the Sunken Caverns and Vivian’s location.
## Random Encounter Table
**Encounter details.**
1. **Militia sparring:** The militia drills recruits in the Shieldgate Barracks. PCs can join the sparring to earn respect or overhear soldiers gossiping about caravans ambushed by “fish‑folk.” A recruit with wet footprints may be a disguised sahuagin spy.
2. **Fisherman’s catch:** At the docks, fishermen haul up a net containing a venomous yellow jellyfish and an iron strongbox inscribed in Aquan. PCs can help subdue the creature (Dexterity checks) and recover the box; inside is a torn map showing a route through the Sunken Caverns.
3. **Market rumour:** In the Windcarve Market, traders complain that trade with other towns has stalled. A suspicious merchant sells dried seaweed amulets; an Insight check reveals the amulets are Aquan holy symbols used to mark undercover agents.
4. **Night‑time blue lights:** Strange blue lights dance along the Whispering Aqueduct at night. Observing the lights reveals sahuagin priests performing a ritual. If the PCs intervene, they can disrupt the magic before it collapses part of the aqueduct.
5. **Ranger messenger:** A ranger from Kestrel Eyrie arrives wounded; her hawk carries a message about increased Aquan raids near the Bay of Kelp. PCs must get her to the mayor and protect the message from thieves.
6. **Brewery festival:** Saltstone Brewery hosts a tasting to prove their ale is safe. PC participation in drinking contests or storytelling can earn trust. During the festivities, a disguised aquan agent tries to slip poison into the ale.    
7. **Archivist’s map:** A nervous scribe from the Plateau Archives shares a brittle parchment showing “Sunken Caverns – Librarian cell” written in Elvish. He asks the PCs to verify its accuracy, leading them toward the final dungeon.
8. **Storm omen ritual:** Tidesages invite townsfolk to witness a powerful omen at the chapel. As waves crash in unusual patterns, a Stormlord symbol glows and whispers Vivian’s name. A successful Religion check interprets the omen as a plea to save her soon or she will be sacrificed.
