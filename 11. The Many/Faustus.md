[[Faustus]] is the leader of [[The Many]]. He is a tall figure, depicted with a glowing, golden headband in all art/mosaics/images of [[The Many]]. 

This member of the many is a blade singer wizard. They wheeled a golden blade, which has a special altar on the top of one of the peaks in the chromatic things. I had this idea where it's basically a pedestal kind of like the sword, the stone and King Arthur and Merlin and the fairytales and all that stuff, but for this, if you join the sword with the basically the rock at the top of the peak, you view it with ungodly powers. Pantheon is a character from League of Legends that Sean seems to like, and I really like the notion that the blade while otherwise not insanely strong, could summon a legion to the side of its wheeler in the time of Crisis.
