[[How-to do World Events]] is needed to give a scale of grandeur to the campaign. When the party is in one location, they need to hear *information from other locations*. This gives a sense of "I am in this world" and not just "I am playing in this world."

1. Make sure the party is somewhere that can be a hub of information: *town, city, trading post*
2. Make sure to reflect the information with *visual descriptions* of tension in the air
3. Information can be conveyed in multiple ways: *direct conversation, eavesdropping, news posting, mission boards, council postings*
4. Then convery the results of something *not* in their current region
5. Pick something drastic and have the news be spread

### Reflecting News
