I was watching a Sidemen video and in one of their challenges they had to decipher some text written on the wall in different colors. It was written in some Heiroglyphic cypher text thing (use arbitrary symbols to represent letters, kind of like the cipher of The Many). 

I want to create a puzzle where you have a confusing spread of symbols, left to right that appear to not make words but when you create words from just their colors it forms a sentence.

```
Red Blue Red Red Yellow Blue Red Blue Yellow Yellow Green Red Blue Green Green
(or something like this)

Then actual word ordering is in the order colors appear:
Red -> Blue -> Yellow -> Green
```

A cool, harder version of this is to have words made from different colors that *makes sense together* so they *think* it is correct but does not work, forcing them to go back and re-do it in the correct fashion.
