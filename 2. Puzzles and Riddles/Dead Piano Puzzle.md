**Idea**
To solve this puzzle, players must play *DEAD* on the piano. That means play D E A D in order on the piano. 

This puzzle could work really well in like the back of a seedy tavern. The riddle itself should be cryptic, but clearly contain the line *play dead* or something similar to that to get them to want to play the piano. It could be written on the piano itself.
