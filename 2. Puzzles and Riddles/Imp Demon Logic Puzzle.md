This puzzle revolves around perspectives and logic.

I really like the idea of tying this to [[The Many]]. A conversation between two members can model the conversation between the greater demons here. Statues of creatures with the eyes can model the imps. The statues can be stone and, when selected as the answer, if wrong attack and if correct lead the party to a solution or an exit. When killed after coming alive as a stone statue, the imp freezes in the position it was killed in. 

[Pandora's puzzle link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbbhyHBSKU) -> watch the video to build and setup the puzzle if using in a session.

Do the following:
- Change the greater demons to members of the many
- Change imps to stone statues of something idk
- Change sin types to colors 
- Keep eyes the same and use same numbers
