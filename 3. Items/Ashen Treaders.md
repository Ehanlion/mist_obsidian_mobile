**Properties.**
- Once per long rest, and when you take fire damage, you may use your reaction to half the incoming damage. When used in this way, your base movement speed on your next turn increases by 10 feet and you Treaders glow a vibrant orange color as you walk. 
- Once per long rest, and when you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you may teleport into your fire. Choose a location that you can see that's inside the area of effect of the spell you cast. You are immune to the damage from your spell, but are still subject to any effects it might cause. If the spell targets a single creature, you can teleport to a location directly next to them.
