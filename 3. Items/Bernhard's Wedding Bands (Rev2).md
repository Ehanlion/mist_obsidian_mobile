**Description.** These are a pair of rings, one wrought from glittering gold and the other composed of shimmering silver with white gemstones. On each are runes that seem to link them together. These appear to be wedding bands. It is clear they were made with absolute love and care.

On the Silver Ring are runes of Chronomancy, and on the Gold Ring are sigils of Druidic nature. It appears the rings have been imbued with powers.
