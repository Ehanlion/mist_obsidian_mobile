**Description.** These are a pair of rings, one wrought from glittering gold and the other composed of shimmering silver with white gemstones. On each are runes that seem to link them together. These appear to be wedding bands. It is clear they were made with absolute love and care.

Very Rare, *Requires Attunement by two creatures*

**Silver Ring Properties.**
- Grants a +1 to your Wisdom score, raising the maximum of this score by 1.
- Grants an additional 10 feet of base movement speed.
- Grants advantage on saving throws against being charmed. 
- *To the side of my lover.* (Proficiency/Long Rest): When the wearer of the *Gold ring* takes damage, you may use this reaction. You move up to half your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks. When moving in this way you must end up closer to the wearer of the *Gold ring* than you were before you took this reaction. Then the wearer of the *Gold ring* is bathed in soft moonlight and any creature has disadvantage on attacks rolls against them until they take damage. 

**Gold Ring Properties.**
- Grants a +1 to your Intelligence score, raising the maximum of this score by 1. 
- Grants resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.
- Grants advantage on saving throws against being charmed.
- *Wedded Casting.* (Proficiency/Long Rest): As long as you can see them, and when you cast a spell, your spell can originate from the wearer of the *Silver ring*. Then the wearer of the *Silver ring* gains advantage on their next attack role, ability check, or saving throw as they hear an invariable ticking of a clock surround them. 

**Paired Properties.** 
- These properties are only gained when two creatures, considered friendly to one another, attune to the rings. 
- *Arcane Communion.* While both rings are attuned and worn, the wearers share a telepathic bond that allows them to communicate instantly, regardless of distance or most obstacles.
- *Harmonized Casting:* If one ring wearer casts a spell, and later in the same round the other ring wearer casts a spell of the same school of magic, the second caster has advantage on the spellâ€™s attack roll. If the spell does not require an attack roll, both creatures instead gain 1d10 temporary hit points.
