**Description.** These are a pair of rings, one wrought from glittering gold and the other composed of shimmering silver with white gemstones. On each are runes that seem to link them together. These appear to be wedding bands, although they clearly had never gotten to be worn before. How sad. It is clear they were made with absolute love and care.

On the Silver Ring are runes of Chronurgy, and on the Gold Ring are sigils of Lunar, Druidic nature. 

Legendary, *Requires Attunement by two creatures*

**Silver Ring Properties.**
- Grants the following bonuses.
	- +2 to your Wisdom score, raising the maximum of this score by 2.
	- +10 feet of base movement speed.
	- Advantage on saving throws against being charmed while within 30 feet of the Gold Ring. 
- *Temporal Precision:* If you don't already, add your intelligence modifier to your intiative score, minimum bonus of +1. 
- *Clockwork Precision*: (2/Day), As a reaction, after you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll.

**Gold Ring Properties.**
- Grants the following bonuses.
	- +2 to your Intelligence score, raising the maximum of this score by 2. 
	- Resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.
	- Advantage on saving throws against being charmed while within 30 feet of the Silver ring.
- *Moonstar's Blessing*: (1/Day). As a bonus action, you transform into a [giant elk](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Giant%20Elk#content), as if you have wild shaped as a Moon Druid. You keep your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Your items meld into your new form. Unlike a normal wild shape, you are capable of casting spells in this form, provided they do not require *somatic* components. When you transform, the wearer of the Silver Ring gains (3d10) temporary hit points. 

**Paired Properties**: These properties are only gained when two creatures, considered friendly to one another, attune to the rings. 
- *Arcane Communion.* While both rings are attuned and worn, the wearers share a telepathic bond they communicate over, regardless of distance, but barring through magical barriers.
- *Shielded Minds*. Both ring wearers are immune to scrying and to any effect that would sense their emotions, read their thoughts, or detect their locations when they are within 30 feet.

If a wearer of one ring, while both are attuned to, dies fully, the silver ring loses its "temporal precision" and "clockwork precision" abilities while the gold ring loses its "Moonstar's blessing" ability. This loss is permanent. They lose their paired properties as well. Their rarity reduces from very rare, to rare.
