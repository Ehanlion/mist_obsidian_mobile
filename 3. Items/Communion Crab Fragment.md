The [[Communion Crab Fragment]] is a small fragment of [[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s shell given to The Higher Priestess the group defeated in The [[First Compound, Battle]]. It grants a dream-audience with [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and allows whoever is touching it to see and gaze upon [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. It also carries with it the images of prophecy that [[Karak-Ulgurath]] besstowed upon [[The Aquan Nations]]. 
# Audience
The [[Communion Crab Fragment]] grants a short audience with [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. It shows its true size, some aspects of its nature, and its fully body. It also shows its lair, deep in [[The Sunken Caverns]]. 
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is a Collosal creature, but is not the godly size they saw in the Bay of Kelp
- Its carapace is wreathed in runes of illusory magic. There are clear conduits on the shell that would allow a spell to be amplified if casted into them. 
- A massive gemstone, like the smaller Mind Rocks they found, is embedded into the crown of its head. It glows blue and is clearly magic. You can feel its powers radiating into you as you view the vision. 
- A cloaked figure stands near the crab in this image, he talks eloquently and appears to be familiar with the crab. He is enscribing new runes onto "his creation." These runes are evocation magic. He boasts that when finished, the crab will reign unstoppable and able to easily level [[Gandoras City]]. This is [[Silvan Gile]]
- The lair is diverse. One section has stalactites and stalagmites, one section has pits of brackish, deep-green waters, one section has an old structure of a temple and a massive statue of a Man holding a Tridet (The Stormlord), one section has what looks like small cells in the walls and here you can see [[Vivian Lovejoy]]. 
# Shred of Prophecy
The [[Communion Crab Fragment]] can replay a fragmented view of the prophecy bestowed upon [[The Aquan Nations]] by [[Karak-Ulgurath]]. It shows the following:
- Towns along [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] burning and people running
- The sea caves of [[The Echoing Grotto]], [[The Shimmermist Lagoon]], and [[The Sunken Caverns]] expanding as the cliffs of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]] crack and fragment. 
- The great walls of [[Gandoras City]] tumbling into King Gillian's Channel. 
- An inland marshland being created, destroying The High Forest and consuming the Fields of Salt, in the center of [[The Whitecliff Plateau]].
