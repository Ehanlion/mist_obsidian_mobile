**Description**
This lance is rough and tarnished with coral growths. Its long metallic body sheathed with wet, living coral. It drips water near-constantly. This weapon is long, almost to an unwieldly degree, but when used properly it can be devastating. If the [[Coral Lance]] is not submerged once every hour, it loses its *Innate Spellcasting*, and *Summon Shark* abilities. 

**Lance:**
*Melee Weapon*, *Close Quarters:* You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted. *Reach:* This weapon adds *5 feet* to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. The lance deals *(1d12)* piercing damage and an additional *(1d6)* poison damage. 

*Charge Attack:* Passive
When you move 20 ft. or more directly towards a target and make an attack roll, that attack deals an additional (1d12) piercing damage. The target then must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. 

*Summon Shark:* (1/day)
While underwater, the lance can be used to summon a friendly shark to your side. A [Hunter Shark](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Hunter%20Shark#content) appears at your side when you are underwater. This creature is friendly to you, follows your orders, implicitly understands you, and goes on your turn in combat. It is considered a steed for you, which you can mount. The shark disappears after 8 hours, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. 

*Innate Spellcasting:*
- Cantrip: The wielder of the [[Coral Lance]] can cast the cantrip [Shape Water](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shape-water)
- 1/day: While underwater, the lance can be used to cast the spell [Watery Sphere](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:watery-sphere), and the save is made against a DC of 16.
