**Description.** This bone rod is carved into the shape of twisting tendrils of tentacles. You can use this rod as an arcane focus.

*This item requires attunement.* Uncommon

**Properties.**
- When you cast a spell that requires an attack roll, you can expend 1 of its charges as part of the casting to enhance that spell. 
- If the attack hits, the spell also releases tendrils that bind the target, grappling it for 1 minute. 
- At the start of each of your turns, the grappled target takes (1d6) damage of the same type dealt by the spell.
- At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, freeing itself from the tendrils on a success. 
- The rod's magic may only grapple one target at a time. 
- If you use the rod to grapple another target, the effect on the previous target ends.
