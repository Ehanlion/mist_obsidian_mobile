**Description:** A thin wand with a blue core. It is small but potent although the blue sparks that it throws off are most disconcerting. You get the strange sensation that this wand requires some level of luck to wield with efficacy. 

**Properties:**
- This wand has 3 charges. 
- While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll a D20, if you roll a 10 or lower, the ray instead hits you.
- The target (or you) must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- The wand regains 1d4-1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
