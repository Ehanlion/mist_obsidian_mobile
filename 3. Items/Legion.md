[[Legion]] is a powerful sword, a true artifact of someone powerful, possibly a god or one of [[The Many]]. 

[[Legion]]'s main power is its ability to summon legions of soldiers to the wielders side. I like the idea of being able to easily summon a small group of soldiers with more difficult summonings yielding a phalanx. 

A more difficult summoning could require concentration saves, induce sustained damage to wielded, or even just be a once time use thing
