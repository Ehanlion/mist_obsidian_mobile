#item 

*This item appears as large, blue orb that is slightly too big to hold with two hands. Inside is sloshing, glittering, blue fluid and a shimmering goldfish floating in the middle. It looks at your with its large eyes. You get the sense the fish can see into the future.*

**Ability**
Once per day you can ask the Goldfish any **yes or no** question. It will swim to your right for **yes** or to your left for **no**. 

The Goldfish has no actual fortelling abilities, but rather floats one direction or the other randomly. The GM rolls for the answer. The players cannot know this.
