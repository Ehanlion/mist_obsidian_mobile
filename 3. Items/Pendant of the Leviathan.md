**Description:**
This pendant is carved of sea stone and embedded with a large, exquisite pearl seated in the center. The pearls is placed such that, in the carving, it looks like a large eye. It its faintly cool to the touch and pulses gently with blue light, like rolling waves upon a wide, sandy beach. It radiates powerful magical energy.

*This item requires attunement.*

**Properties:**
1. You gain resistance to cold damage. 
2. Whenever you deal damage with a spell, that spell deals an additional (1d6) cold damage. This extra damage may only be applied once per round. 
3. Once per long rest, when you cast a spell of 5th level of lower that deals damage, you can maximize the damage of the spell. However, you must choose to do this before the spell is cast. When you use this trait, the damage type of the spell is transmuted to cold damage. If the spell requires an attack role and you miss, the cold enthralls you and your movement speed is halved at the start of your next turn.
