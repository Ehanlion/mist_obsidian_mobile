**Description.** This long, elegant pipe is engraved with dark lines and swirls. Inside is a dense crystal of red rock, emitting a smoky aroma of premium smoking rock. The scent is like ground up chalk, spiced cinnamon and cloves, alongside salt.

**Properties.**
- As an action, you can inhale and exhale a billowing cloud from the pipe, blowing a pungent cloud of Red Rock into the air. You must first make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you take 2d12 necrotic damage and are afflicted with *Red Rock High.* On a success, you are unaffected and blow a thick cloud of smoke in a 15 foot cone. All creatures in the cone now make the same saving throw.
- This feature may be used twice per long rest, however the pipe can still be smoked normally. A creature smoking the pipe can willfully get high without taking damage by only taking small puffs. 
- *Red Rock High:* a creature under the effects of Red Rock High is considered confused and is blinded beyond 30 feet. A creature afflicted in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success and becoming immune for 24 hours.
