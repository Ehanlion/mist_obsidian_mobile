The [[Scene Transmission Device]] is a large metal contraption. If used correctly, it can transmit a one minute recording of something to be replayed at a later date. This is a technomagic device. It is a product of [[Gandoras City]].

To use the device do the following:
- Setup and configure the device to record, Intelligence Check
- Choose when to record and hit the button.
- At end of minute of recording, the device stops recording and makes a massive cracking noise.
- Once this noise passes, the device anchors to the ground and begins to countdown. It will take 30 seconds to charge up and then transmit the recording to the reciever. 
- In this stage it is vulnerable and can be destroyed, rendering the transmission useless.
