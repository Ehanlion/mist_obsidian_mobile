*This armor is Splint Armor, granting a base AC of 17, disadvantage on stealth, and requiring 15 Strength to wear.*

**Description:** This armor looks rough and ragged. Its edges are crab-like and sharp. It's carapace is mottled green, blue, and black. On the inside of the armor are what looks like hundreds of wriggling hairs that glisten and writhe. 

While wearing this armor you gain an additional +1 bonus to your AC. You have resistance to the following damage types: *necrotic, poison, acid, psychic, and cold*. 

**Symbiotic nature**: the armor cannot be removed from you once you attune to it. You cannot voluntarily end your attunement to it. You cannot wear another set of armor while attuned to this armor. If you are targeted by a spell that ends a curse, the armor falls off. If the armor is removed in any way, you are subject to **Removing the Armor (hidden).**

This armor requires fresh blood to feed. Immediately after finishing any long rest you must feed the armor half (rounded up) of your hit die. If you do not or cannot do this, you immediately suffer a level of exhaustion. For every sequential day of not feeding the armor, the exhaustion penalty increase by one, resetting once you feed it. For every level of exhaustion gained this way, your Strength is reduced by 2.
