Modelled off of this: [living armor](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:living-armor) 

**Description:** this armor looks rough and ragged. Its edges are crab-like and sharp. It's carapace is mottled green, blue, and black. On the inside of the armor are what looks like hundreds of wriggling hairs that glisten and move. 

While wearing this armor you gain an additional +1 bonus to your AC. You have resistance to the following damage types: *necrotic, poison, acid, psychic, and cold*. 

**Synbiotic nature**: the armor cannot be removed from you once you attune to it. You cannot voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you are targeted by a spell that ends a curse you are immediately subject to the effects of [[#Removing the Armor]]. Then the armor detaches from you. 

This armor requires fresh blood to feed. Immediately after finishing any long rest you must feed the armor half (rounded up) of your hit die. If you do not, you immediately suffer a level of exhaustion. 
###### Removing the Armor
If the armor is removed, you immediately take 10d10 necrotic damage. This damage cannot be reduced in any way. You then gain 3 levels of exhaustion immediately.
