**Description:**
This seemingly innocuous tapestry, while being beautifully decorated with fabulous scenes, is actually inscribed with a series of magical runes. These runes imbue the carpet with magic. The carpet itself is quite large, 10 ft. by 10 ft. and is very heavy, weighing almost 60 lbs. 

**Ability:**
This rug's magic allows it to block sounds. When covering something entirely, like fully spanning a passage way, covering up a creature, or being draped over a convenient pit, no sound can pass through the tapestry. This effect is only present if fully covering something. If the tapestry is disturbed while being used in this way, its magic ceases to function.
