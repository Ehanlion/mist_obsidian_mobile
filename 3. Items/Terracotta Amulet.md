**Properties.**
- Once per long rest, when you deal damage to one or more creatures, you can invoke the amuletâ€™s power as part of the same action. A surge of thick, foul mud erupts from your attack, coating a number of creatures affected by your damage, up to your proficiency bonus.
- *Muddy Coating*: Each coated creature has their movement speed reduced by 10 feet. The mud remains until the creature uses its action to remove it.
- *Terracotta Binding*: If the mud is subjected to magical fire damage on a subsequent turn, it hardens into a brittle shell. Each affected creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a success, the mud fractures and crumbles.
	- A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check to escape. If the restrained creature takes damage, they gain advantage on all subsequent escape checks as the shell weakens.
