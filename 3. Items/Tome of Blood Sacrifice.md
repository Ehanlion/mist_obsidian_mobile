**Description**
[[The Tome of Blood Sacrifice]] is a cryptic, dark, sadistic tome filled with cruel rituals. It contains four powerful rituals used to imbue the magic of a spellcaster with a sinister, blood-fueled power. These rituals describes carvings of runes into the body, dark meditations, ungodly incantations, and mutterings that must be followed to gain the powers described in the book. By using a spellcaster's own magic, they can fuel the rituals the tome describes and complete the transformation. These transformations cause distinct, noticeable, physical alterations to your form. 

**The Item**
This item allows a user to spend their *hit dice* to empower *magical spells*. To gain these augmentations, a caster must complete a ritual. There are four rituals of increasingly powerful levels. To complete a higher level ritual, all prior rituals must be completed. Each ritual requires a series of spell slots to be used, specific to the ritual. Each ritual takes a specified number of days and while enduring the ritual, a creature does not sleep and does not rest. Each ritual requires a circle of the caster's blood to be inscribed in the ground surrounding them. At the end of everyday, a creature makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against exhaustion. A creature must continue the ritual to completion and of their own free will, they cannot escape the ritual. If a creature fails to complete the ritual or is removed from the ritual circle they inscribe to begin the ritual, they immediately suffer (8d10) necrotic damage and their constitution score is permanently reduced by 2. If a creature completes the ritual, they gain access to that ritual's *augmentations* and increases an ability score of their choice by one and decreases an ability score of their choice by one. No score can be increased above 20. This is done everytime a ritual is completed.

**Using Augmentations**
When a creature wishes to use an augmentation, first they always deal an amount of damage to themselves equal to the dice cost of the augmentation, usually this is 1 hit die but other times is can be more than one hit die. This is called the *blood cost*. The *blood cost* will get used in the augmentation's description. This is like you "using" your blood or pain to fuel something you do. Then, they may do as their augmentation describes. An augmentation is can only be used when casting a spell, unless otherwise specified. An augmentation may only be used at most once per turn.
