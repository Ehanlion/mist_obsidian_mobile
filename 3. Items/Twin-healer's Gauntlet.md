[[Twin-healer's Gauntlet]] is a potent healing artifact that grants the user the ability to cast healing spells. 

This item should grant the wielder the ability to cast a spell like healing word as part of their native spell casting. I like the idea that this item lets the caster target, not one, but two people as a benefit of wearing the gauntlet.

Ability: twin target, when you cast healing word with [[Twin-healer's Gauntlet]], you can spend one charge to target two creatures instead of just one.
