I was watching a clip from critical roll and I saw them fighting some dude named vocodo? Absolutely wrong name but phonetically correct. Anyways, he had a field around him that reflected magic spells. 

**Panic at the Disco**
Whenever a spell targets [[Disco Ball Monster]], the [[Disco Ball Monster]] makes a spell saving throw against a DC, kind of like counterspell. If successful, the spell is redirected at a target of the [[Disco Ball Monster]]'s choosing. 

This effect applies to spells that either target the [[Disco Ball Monster]] or a space within 15 ft of it, since this effect is an AoE. 

**Key Notes about this**
This will 100% make casters feel useless because, I know my players, and the casters won't even bother to take the risk and cast. 

To fix this, there has to be some way of hurting the [[Disco Ball Monster]] without directly targeting it. Maybe by damaging something that empowers it or empowers it AoE.
