**The Boss Battle**
In a [[Boss Battle]], it is important from the start that lives should be in danger. Other fights might have threats, but a party should expect at least some of them to die in a [[Boss Battle]]. These are saga ending battles. In my eyes, each level of the campaign should have a distinct boss battle or two in it. They are the closers to chapters of a story. These should be expected, well telegraphed, known about, and built towards. It is REALLY bad design to just HAVE a Boss-level entity in a dungeon and then you're in a boss fight. These should be well established enemies, known about for many session, and generally hated or feared or both for that duration. 

Bosses should have powerful abilities and legendary actions and resistances. Bosses need to have Mythic Creature Traits and boss level abilities. They should have phases where they get more powerful, but easier to kill along the way. They should have convention-challenging abilities that push the norms of D&D. 

These ideas in a list form:
1. Powerful abilities and actions
2. Legendary actions and abilities
3. Mythic Traits that grant empowered Legendary Actions
4. Phases as their HP diminishes
5. Convention-challenging abilities
