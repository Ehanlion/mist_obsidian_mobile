**The Puzzle Battle**
In this, the goal is rather vaguer that other battle varieties. The goal realistically shouldn't be the enemy, but the environment? Or if it IS the enemy, your goal doesn't necessarily have to eb to kill that enemy. Or if the goal is to kill them, maybe it takes a unique approach to do so. 

*Example:*
The Sun Aspect, Friedanor is slow but he is adept at redirecting attacks. You observe that he can spend a reaction to redirect an attack directly back at you. But you know he only has one reaction. Thus begins a game of feigning bad attacks as powerful attacks and waiting to deliver powerful blows AFTER Friedanor uses his redirect.

*Example:*
Mungo, the thousand armed beast, is a massive millepede with a human face. You recognize quickly that he is legendarily difficult to kill with a brutal AC and very, very high pool of hit points. But you also know that he is rushing to eat the Egg of the Scurlog. If you can beat him to the egg, he won't eat it and gain its powers. Without defeating him, you still defeat him because without the egg, he can't terrorize the nearby Fief as his powers dwindle. Thus the combat transforms into a race instead, where you need to get to the egg first and destroy it.
