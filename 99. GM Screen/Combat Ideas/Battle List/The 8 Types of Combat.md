**Notes about battles**
I realizes this, while watching [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5-vF14pUBE) about combat, that I have realistically only run [[Skirmish Battle]]s and [[Boss Battle]]s. But there are GREAT other options to choose from here. Every battle should be different, at least to the point where *types* are not being repeated (even if the *enemy creatures* are a repeat). 

Maybe a skirmish group flees, alerts a group and they stage an ambush. Then they are defeated, but know one player is the issue. The next battle they send out a hit squad to lead a targeted battle against them. When that fails, they try their elite team against them. 

I think [[Ambush Battle]]s are good as a stand-alone. 
But I think for the others, like [[Targeted Strike Battle]]s and [[Elite Team Battle]]s, these need *telegraphing*. A powerful squad of elites makes no sense if there isn't a *reason* for them to send the strong Krugs.
