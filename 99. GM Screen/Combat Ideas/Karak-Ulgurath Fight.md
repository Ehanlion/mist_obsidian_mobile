This fight will take place in the [[Sunken Caverns]]
[[Karak-Ulgurath]] is powerful and cannot be fought outright, to defeat it, and rescue [[Vivian Lovejoy]] they party needs an ally

Folklore bullshit:
- crabs hate octopus
- So a giant crab hates a giant octopus -> the group needs a baby kraken to front with [[Karak-Ulgurath]]

The real fight, they should know going in, will be to disable magical altars or shrines setup by [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[Silvan Gile]] to empower the crab
- [[Tennyson Heralds]] ones powerup the crabs magic and foresight and controlling magic
- [[Silvan Gile]] ones powerup its form and physical form that it takes

This battle should be long and diverse
Add magical plants that when hit, give small rest effects and temp hit points and spells back but one time use only. 
Have enemy use they first, to telegraph function
Also going to be trying to rescue [[Vivian Lovejoy]]

So the battle has these elements:
- Large battle between [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and a Baby Kraken (only to buy time for party)
- Battle with [[Aquan War]] troops while trying to disable the Altars from [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[Silvan Gile]]
- Search and rescue mission to safely rescue [[Vivian Lovejoy]] from her captors, [[Fedorov's Legion]]. They are a threat and are actively moving her and will take her away from this place soon if they are not stopped. [[Vivian Lovejoy]] will be getting taken to [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and to be taken to [[Stormlocked Frontier]] to work on the Shard
- [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Silvan Gile]] show up to collect the Shard that was found just before party arrives

This battle needs to establish the following:
- [[Aquan Nations]] are on the warpath and will go on it with or without [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
- Killing [[Karak-Ulgurath]] will help [[Gandoras City]] buy time for itself and save them casualties
- [[Fedorov's Legion]], [[Followers of Alsolace]], and [[Iron-fist Marauders]] are the masterminds behind this
- There is more to [[Mist]] than this battle, but the real threat is East, first in [[Gandoras City]] to find [[Tennyson Heralds]] there, but then east towards [[Fedorov's Legion]] and [[Iron-fist Marauders]]
- [[Aquan Nations]] found a powerful artifact, the Shard and it is now in the hands of [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Silvan Gile]]. 

I need to make them, in this fight and the sessions leading up to this HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE [[Fedorov Barovick VII]] and [[Silvan Gile]], and [[Tennyson Heralds]]
And they need to start to hate [[Garrick Blackthorn]]
