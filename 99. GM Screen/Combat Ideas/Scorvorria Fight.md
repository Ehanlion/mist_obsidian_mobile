**Fight with:** [[Scorvorria the Ember Greatwyrm]] in [[Scorvorian Peaks]]

**Ideas**:
- *Glyphs* which are large constructs with magical enchantments empower [[Scorvorria the Ember Greatwyrm]] in her lair. They can each be damaged form only within 30 feet. They each empower an aspect of her:
	1. Healing glyph - she regains 200 hit points each round, on initiative count 20
	2. Movement glyph - she acts under the effects of the haste spell
	3. Darkness glyph - the vast center chasm of her lair is surrounded by magical darkness which she can see through. This darkness grants her resistance to all damage, and immunity to cold damage and necrotic damage.
- *Heat Fatigue* The lair is so hot that it is hard to fight. At the start of a turn, a creature makes a DC 4 Con save versus exhaustion. This DC increases at initiative count 20 (with lair actions) by 2 every round. 
- *Steam Vents*: these vents launch a creature into the air but deal a small amount of fire damage (1d6) "steam" damage. They launch you 60 feet into the air, and you float to the ground as if under the effects of a feather fall spell. 

This lair is massive, it should feel like it was made for a dragon, [[Scorvorria the Ember Greatwyrm]], to fly around inside it with ease
