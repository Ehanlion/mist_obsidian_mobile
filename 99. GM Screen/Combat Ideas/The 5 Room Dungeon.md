**Preface**
[[The 5 Room Dungeon]] is not just a dungeon, but also a storytelling mechanic. It exists to be loosely followed as a structure or framework. By dungeon here we mean a location in D&D where adventure takes place and by room we mean a part of that dungeon. 

**Breakdown**
1. Entrance
2. Puzzle
3. Setback
4. Climax
5. Resolution

What makes this good:
- Easy to make, good GM muscle stretch
- Easy to finish in one session

**Instructions**
1. *Select a theme:* create something consistent for the dungeon
	1. maybe Orcs
	2. Or goblins
	3. or the undead, pick something consistent
2. *Get Inspired:* really this is tandem with selecting a theme because you need to be inspired to create
	1. Look at popular media
	2. Browse art online
	3. Read through the art in parts of the D&D core books
	4. (and look at buying Dungeons and Dragons, Art & Arcana)
3. *Now breakout and look at the rooms*: that was planning, now time to think about each room

**The Entrance**
- This answers the question of "Why wasn't this dungeon already looted?"
- The entrance should be trapped, hidden, or guarded 
- If it is guarded, you need to be able to answer the questions of "how do the enemies get back into the dungeon?" The next room will be the Puzzle Room, so we need to have a clear mechanism or clue on the guards (if it makes sense that they would have to traverse the puzzle) that contributes to solving the puzzle. 

Also, it is acceptable to FLIP the Entrance and the puzzle. Instead of a guardian outside the puzzle room, instead a guardian protects the entrance of the rest of the dungeon behind the door out of the puzzle room. 

**The Puzzle**
- Ideally this speaks to story-driven players
- It should be something ideally solvable in less than an hour?

**The Setback**
- Ideally, this is the "meat" of the dungeon
- This should be something like a large trap, a combat encounter of something the players can handle, and a big room to go with it
- Cliches ARE okay here, some skeletons in a crypt are always expected but would be good here
- Leverage different kinds of combat like [[Hordes Battle]] or a [[Skirmish Battle]]
- We want the players to burn resources and hit points here while not feeling able to rest.
