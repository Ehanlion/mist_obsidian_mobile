Preface: I was considering a battle, like Marvell Rivals or TF2, where your goal is to hold and secure an objective for a time. Obviously, in D&D this isn't a video game capture point, but maybe more of an objective you need to power-up over the course of a couple rounds. 

**Ideas:**
- A series of Rune rocks that requires the input of magical spells to grow in power.
	- There are N-stones
	- Each one has to be powered up in series.
	- Each one takes some amount of spell slots to power up
	- When they power-up, they grant buffs and effects for the combat
	- OR they can serve to WEAKEN another objective
- This could be translated to a ritual-breaker fight?
	- the enemy has casted a ritual, it is fully done and now something is happening
	- But nearby there are interactives, maybe a stone circle, an ancient gravestone, a magic tree, IDK
	- These can be overtaken by the group by using magic, or a puzzle, or strength or something
	- Regardless, each one takes the concentrated action of one creature to do
	- And the other have to defend them
	- OR, instead, they can just work together to activate them.
	- The point should be that the enemy can COUNTER their attempts with their own abilities
