I think for the new campaign with Max/Sean/Ashley, we will use the new 5.5e rules instead of 5. If I reboot the main campaign, I will do the same.

1. **Expanded Death Saves:** death saves are no longer just live or die, succeeding gives added benefits. 
2. **Potions**: potions as bonus action for self, action to give to another. For health potions, using an action to drink heals the max and a bonus action heals the dice. Using an action to feed someone a health potion heals the dice.
