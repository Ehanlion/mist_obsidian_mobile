The [[Dehydration]] condition should be used when running survival challenges. A creature must consume enough water to survive, unless their race specifies otherwise. A creature that does not consume enough water will suffer exhaustion and will be unable to rest properly. 

##### Rules for Dehydration
- A adventuring creature must consume **1 gallon of water a day.**
- In an extreme, or hot environment, this **increases to 2 gallons / day.**
- This can even be increase to 3 gallons, but only in extreme circumstance. 
- If the creature cannot consume this amount, they make a **DC 15 Con save** at the end of the day (start of a long rest). If they drink less than half the amount, they automatically fail. A failure grants one level of exhuastion.
- If the creature already has one or more levels of exhaustion, they takes two levels in either case.
- If a creature gains one or more levels of exahustion from [[Dehydration]], they are unable to gain the effects of a long rest, instead gaining the effects of a short rest. 
	- *Note:* A creature can long rest, even when gaining a point of exahustion immediatly before, as long as that exhaustion does not come from [[Dehydration]]. 

# Footnote About Water
Water is very heavy! It weighs 10 lbs (actually 8.34 ish in real world, but rounded up) per *gallon*. For a normal creature in a normal climate, to make a week's long journey, assuming no water resupply, would require carrying `70 lbs of water.` If it was hot, this would increase to `140 lbs of water.` 

For an adventuring party of 4, going through a hot desert for 2 weeks would require `4 people * 14 days * 2 gallons / day = 112 gallons` or `1120 lbs of water!` 

A party needs pack animals for a long, isolate journey. Or they must rely on resupplying water daily through natural means!
