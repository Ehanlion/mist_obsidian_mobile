# List of Links
What follows is a list of sources that I found as I worked on this adventure. The range is diverse and spanning..
1. [Great Git-Hub based bestiary](https://dr-eigenvalue.github.io/bestiary/) - Excellent source for some weird to find monsters here. 
2. [dandwiki 5e monster Homebrew](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/5e_Monsters) - great homebrew monster list, warning it is really really not balanced at all and you need to vet the creatures found in here. 
3. [Skill Challenges and Tension](https://www.optionalrule.com/2021/01/03/progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition/) - source that teaches how to run skill challenges with a progressive check system, allowing for failures and innovation in the moment. 
4. [Ideas for more combat interactions and weird combats](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/orc5a3/what_are_fun_elements_that_can_be_added_to_combat/)
5. [Roll 20 General Rules Landing Page](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules#content)
6. [A general website about 34 dungeon trap ideas](https://www.bastionland.com/2018/08/34-good-traps.html?m=1)
7. [Stat Block Generator](https://tetra-cube.com/dnd/dnd-statblock.html) - Awesome stat block generator with the ability to save the creature's file as a ".monster" file type
8. [Link to cool Magic Staffs etc.](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/magic-items/rods-staves-wands/) - This can add a lot of cool magical staffs for the party to get or learn about. 
9. [5esrd Master Magic Items List](https://www.5esrd.com/database/magicitem/) - This is a full list of every possible magic item that the players could use. It is both RAW and add-on rules sets, as well as some home-brew (I think).
10. [Wikidot RAW Magic Items List](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items) - list of RAW available magic items that can be offered to players, sorted by rarity which is nice. 
11. [Rainworld Creatures](https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Creatures) and [Rainworld Regions](https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Regions) - links to the Rainworld wiki pages because I love the style of their content
