# The Archery Competition

This challenge is a friendly archery competition. Characters line up to compete in an archery competition where they will rapidly shoot arrows, attempting to hit a target. The first creature to scrore *a certain amount of hits* on their target wins the competition.

> This concept can be architected around anything really. Darts, stone throwing, whatever. The idea is to map a "hit a target" task to a "roll a certain amount of successes to win" challenge.

# Roll to Win

Players compete to win by physically rolling as fast as possible. Each player will roll dice as fast as possible. They are constrained to just one die for the challenge. All players roll into one area at the same time. 

Here are the rules laid out:
1. The first player to roll $N$ successes wins the competition.
2. You must only use one Die for this challenge.
3. Roll on your own, and as fast as possible, winning depends on your phsyical dice-rolling-speed.
4. All competing players roll into one pre-agreed upon area at the same time.
