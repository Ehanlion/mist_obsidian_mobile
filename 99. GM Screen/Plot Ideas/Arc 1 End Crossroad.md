The [[Arc 1 End Crossroad]] marks the end of the players realizing what the hell is happening. They just rescued 60 miners from an ancient compound by completing [[First Compound, Battle]] and [[First Compound, Prison Break]]. They are camping in The High Forests (Widowmaker's Stands) in the TOMT. 
## Ending this Arc
- We have done enough sea creatures for now
- I want to start to drive the party east to cooler shit and bigger mystery
- I want to wrap up this arc within 5-10 sessions tops
- It should end at level 7, get level 7 right before entering [[Sunken Caverns]]
- The arc ends with the party in [[Gandoras City]] with an audience to see [[Seat of Stone]] and tell them of the plight of [[Whitecliff]]
## What they should know
1. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is a giant magical crab with a big mind rock in its carapace
2. The [[Aquan Nations]] are conspiring with:
	1. [[Fedorov's Legion]]
	2. [[Iron-Fist Marauders]]
	3. [[Tennyson Heralds]] and [[Followers of Alsolace]]
3. The [[Aquan Nations]] are leading a new war against [[Whitecliff]], then [[Gandoria]]
4. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] ordained the [[Aquan Nations]] with a prophecy to conquer [[Whitecliff]] and [[Gandoria]] in retribution for the past [[Aquan War]]
5. The prophecy tells that conquering [[Whitecliff]] and [[Gandoria]] will lead the [[Aquan Nations]] to peace, prosperity, and new beginnings. 
6. Attacks are planned by the [[Aquan Nations]] in next 2 weeks against the southern towns of the [[Whitecliff Plateau]], these towns are a front to disguise [[Fedorov's Legion]] moving Shard + Librarians from [[Sunken Caverns]] back east. 
	1. Trawlrock: walled town with milita
	2. Herringshold: town of fisherman mages
	3. Schooner's End: mundane town 
7. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] has a main base in the depths of the [[Sunken Caverns]]
8. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is the "aspect" of the Stormlord, the god of the [[Aquan Nations]], and arrived far earlier that usual (normally 500 years, but sooner this time)
9. [[Vivian Lovejoy]] is trapped in the [[Sunken Caverns]]
10. [[Vivian Lovejoy]] is alive for now
11. The captured miners from [[First Compound, Prison Break]] were mining for a powerful artifact from an underwater ancient temple
12. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is NOT instrumental to success of the [[Aquan Nations]] BUT killing [[Karak-Ulgurath]] would weaken the [[Aquan Nations]] allowing [[Gandoria]] to mount a war effort
13. [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is the "patron" of most of the casters in the [[Aquan Nations]]

## What I need them to learn
- A war is brewing and killing [[Karak-Ulgurath]] will buy enough time to raise the alarm in [[Gandoras City]] with [[Seat of Stone]]
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is created, its power derived from a statue to The Stormlord
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is not vastly large, that was a powerful illusion, it is collosal in size and slow
- In 2 weeks from S32, under the cover of the raids on [[Whitecliff]], the librarians and miners are being moved east because the [[Aquan Nations]] have found a shard of [[Fedorov's Legion]]
- Good reasons to kill [[Karak-Ulgurath]]:
	1. Is patron to casters in [[Aquan Nations]], killing weakens magic abilities
	2. Powerful siege monsters, could be used against [[Gandoras City]]

%%## Moving forward
I only want to keep a list of "what they should know" and "what they should now be told" rather than write a plot arc for the next segment. I will wait until after S33, the session post-[[First Compound, Prison Break]], to choose what to create. Hearing the party decide will be key. 
%%
%%**Some running ideas:**
- Go help towns that are about to be attacked
- Escort miners to a nearby town or to [[Gandoras City]]
- Rush to the [[Sunken Caverns]] to rescue [[Vivian Lovejoy]] ASAP
- Ignore [[Karak-Ulgurath]]
- Battle [[Karak-Ulgurath]] and kill it
- Attack [[Tennyson Heralds]] for whatever reason

**Most likely ones:**
- Escort miners to nearest town + help defend if possible
- Rush to [[Sunken Caverns]] to rescue [[Vivian Lovejoy]]

**Good hook ideas**
- Need party to go to [[Gandoras City]]
- No matter where they go, introduce a patrol of soldiers from [[Gandoria]] as a "roaming patrol"
- This patrol is scheduled and they are replacing soldiers somewhere that never responded
- Generally unaware of scale of issue
- Liasson to talk to [[Seat of Stone]] after [[Sunken Caverns]], they can get party audience in [[Gandoria]]%%

## Final Steps
- Party chose to escort miners to Trawlrock, the walled town
- They have been given a 10 day deadline to reach the [[Sunken Caverns]] and free [[Vivian Lovejoy]] before she, and the Librarians + Shard, are taken East. 
- Attacks will happen in 10 days to disguise [[Fedorov's Legion]] moving the librarians and the Shard back east. 
- They can rendezvous with troops sent by His Majesty to Trawlrock for aid
