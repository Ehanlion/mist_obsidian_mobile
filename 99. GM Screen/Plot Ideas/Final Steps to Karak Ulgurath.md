The group has rescued the miners from the compound, all 60 of them, and have headed south to Trawlrock. Here they have 10 days to make it to the [[Sunken Caverns]] before the librarians, [[Vivian Lovejoy]], and a recovered "shard" are transported east out of reach of the party. The group knows that, from His Majestry, a group of loyal soldiers (loyal both to HIs Majesty and the [[Seat of Stone]]) are coming to meet the group at Trawlrock. They will be there in a couple days depending on weather. 

Current active things:
- [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] communicated with His Majesty in [[Gandoras City]] to send support, His Majesty sent a troop of solider to Trawlrock to aid them.
- Rescued miners told party that [[Fedorov's Legion]] and the [[Aquan Nations]] are pulling out resources from [[Sunken Caverns]]. They have found a Shard. Librarians and Shard will be transported East in 2 Weeks (10 days from S33)
- Group brough Miners safely to Trawlrock, only walled city on [[Whitecliff Plateau]]. 
- Other towns of interest now: 1. Trawlrock, walled town, strong militia, 2. Herringshold, powerful mages and runestones, and 3. Schooner's End, fast boats but nothing else.
