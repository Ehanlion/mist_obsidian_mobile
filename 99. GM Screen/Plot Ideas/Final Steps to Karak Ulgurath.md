The group has rescued the miners from the compound, all 60 of them, and have headed south to Trawlrock. Here they have 10 days to make it to the [[Sunken Caverns]] before the librarians, [[Vivian Lovejoy]], and a recovered "shard" are transported east out of reach of the party. The group knows that, from His Majestry, a group of loyal soldiers (loyal both to HIs Majesty and the [[Seat of Stone]]) are coming to meet the group at Trawlrock. They will be there in a couple days depending on weather.
