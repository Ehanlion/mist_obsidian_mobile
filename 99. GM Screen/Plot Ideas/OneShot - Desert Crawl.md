Premise:
Party is a group of adventurers who know each other. They come from and work for a militia in the south and must cross [[Scorchsand Wastes]] wastes. 

Their goal, to recover and find an artifact that was being escorted across the wastes that went missing. The party knows what the artifact was and what it looks like. They also know about the group that was escorting it. The group has a well known leader to the party (with personal connections) and well known talismans that can be identified. 

## A 3 Act Villain
Break the villain up into 3 main acts. In the first session the party gets a feel for their characters and the campaign. Low stakes. At the end, the villain ambushes them. 

During this ambush the villain wears black, red, and gold robes and sits astride a black horse. They wear the talisman from the leader on their wrists and it's easily visible. The party beats the ambush but the villain does not attack and just retreats instead. 

The second act can be coming across the remains of another party, and then maybe the initial party the group was set out to find. This can give clues about methods and actions of the villain. As well as hints as to who they are. 

### identifying the villain
A fun way to indentify the villain:
Give the party a handout of 9 known baddies that pillage the wastes. Let 6 of them be from the wastes and 3 of them from outside. The villain will be one of the ones from outside. This can tie them to **the Black guard** a faction that is known to be from the [[Stormlocked Frontier]] (on the *wrong side of the mountains!*)

Make sure there are 4 villains who are similar in appearance demeanor etc. Have some things be known and others unknown. Let them play a game of deciding who it is.
