### Miner Lore
The miners rescued from [[First Compound, Prison Break]] and The First Compound have some tidbits of information about the happenings of the [[Aquan Nations]] while they were in there. This information is basic and the main gist should be conveyed in just one line to a player.
### Lore Table
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is the awakened aspect of The Stormlord
- The Awakened Aspect arrives every 500 years to proclaim a prophecy for the [[Aquan Nations]] that will guide the next 500 years
- The [[Aquan Nations]] are motivated becasue of a great war with [[Gandoria]] in their past
- There are other miners in labor prisons in the other sea caves
- The [[Sunken Caverns]] are deep and surrounded by legend, few travel down into them
- [[Fedorov's Legion]] is soon set to depart [[Whitecliff]], it seems they have other plans to the East
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is not instrumental to the victory of the [[Aquan Nations]]. But if left alive, it would be a powerful siege engine against [[Gandoras City]]
- ==In 2 weeks from S32, under the cover of the raids on [[Whitecliff]], the librarians and miners are being moved east because the [[Aquan Nations]] have found a shard of [[Fedorov's Legion]]==
- [[Karak-Ulgurath]] is NOT instrumental to success of the [[Aquan Nations]] BUT killing [[Karak-Ulgurath]] would demoralize and weaken the [[Aquan Nations]] long enough to mount a better war effort against them from [[Gandoria]]
