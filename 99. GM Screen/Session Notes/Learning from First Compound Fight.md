# Takeaways
- Less enemies in combat is good. 
- Create more potent boss enemy, increase damage and HP to maximize deadliness. Limit minions to 3 max. 
- Make map dynamic, but don't limit terrarin. Water is cool, but have normal terrain as well. Actually use both terrarin types. Cater to all movement types.

# The Good
- Map design was cool in theory, the notion of a multi-level arena where the water rises is nifty, and I think lair actions were promising
- Physical map implementation was good with plastic, clear screens
- Verticality was good and interactives of 1. Healing, 2. Miners were good.
- Combat is cool if there are NPCs that side with players
- Sean/Ashley like companion NPCs that make sense story-wise
# The Bad
- Warm zones to clear Cold Frostburn stacks was not clearly described, Sean thinks it wasn't obvious that it could be helpful
- Challenging to use the Warmth zone given it was underwater and movement was hard. No value for frontlines because would take out of martial combat
- I think more could be done with an underwater combat rather than just "this place is full of water"
- I think having a difference in terrain e.g. land and water could add value for both martials and casters
