#### Session Recap
The group escaped the [[First Compound, Battle]] via the [[First Compound, Prison Break]] adventure. They used a combinations of scouting, stealth, and aiding the hurt Miners to expedite the process. They used secret passages they discovered to sneak their way out. When necessary, the group took on small hallway battles to clear the way. Deion spearheaded these battles. Before the exit was one final battle with Aquavarion, the right hand to Avalon (the Higher Priestess). He monologued about the hatred of [[Gandoria]] and [[Whitecliff]] by the [[Aquan Nations]]. He claimed it derived from the creation of King Gillian's Channel and the fight that [[Gandoria]] mounted against the [[Aquan Nations]] then. He claimed [[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s only main purpose was to proclaim the prophecy of the [[Aquan Nations]]. This prophecy foretold that they would claim [[Whitecliff]] and topple [[Gandoria]] as revenge for the long ago crusade. The group defeated him and escaped with the Miners to hide in the Tent of Many Things.

Valyra noticed the portrait of [[Bernhard]] and [[Valentino]] that was hanging in The First Compound was magically added to the walls of The Tent of Many Things. 

The group got [[Bernhard's Wedding Bands]]
