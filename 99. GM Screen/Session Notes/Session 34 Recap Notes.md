## Event Timeline
- The group began their day overlooking [[Trawlrock]] and making their way towards the town with the group of 60 rescued miners in tow
- [[Trawlrock]] is the only walled town in [[Whitecliff]]
	- The walls are hewn from white rock, assumed to be mined from the cliffs
	- The walls are around 20 feet tall and show signs of wear and tear along their faces
	- The area surrounding the walls has been developed as arable land, boasting dense fields of crops, clusters of orchards and trees, and the usual swatches of tall sea grass 
- There are some notable things visible while marching towards the town
	- A large gatehouse with a portcullis is conjoined with the surrounding wall
	- Guards are easily visible not only outside the gatehouse but also atop the walls
	- To the south-east of the town is an area of rifts, crevasses, and ruts. There are some old structures here as well, assumed to be an aqueduct at one point, hence its name of the *Whispering Aqueduct* 
- The group was stopped and question by the [[Trawlrock]] militia at crossbow-point. The group was not allowed within the town until the next morning because the guardsmen were scanning and searching people for barnacles.
	- Some miners were allowed in, but only the really injured ones
	- Kiro was commended by the sages of the town for their healing efforts
	- Here the group met some sages from the town's chapel, called *Tidesage Chapel*
- Here they met the captain of the militia, named *Grickma Tideguard*
- Grickma offered, in the morning, to setup an audience with the town's mayor, named *Mara Saltreef* so they could relay what information they were adamant about conveying
- The group rested the night
	- At this point, the group has 9 days until, from what they have learned, [[Fedorov's Legion]] will take the ancient "Shard" and the librarians east. 
	- In 9 days as well, the group knows attacks will be levied against the southern towns of [[Whitecliff]]
	- They discovered the attack on [[Trawlrock]] will have between 250-1000 attacking members of the [[Aquan Nations]]
- On the next morning the group re-visited the entrance to town
- While the miners were brought in, the group was escorted into the town by Grickma
- Upon entering they saw the following important locations:
	- *Cliffwatch Tower:* Old signal lighthouse turned militia keep that grips the clfif edge
	- *Dockshaft Grotto:* A slew of winding hoist-shaft carved into the white chalk cliffs
	- *Windcarve Market:* A canvas studded bazaar on the cliff's rim
	- *Saltstone Brewery:* A famed brewery for briny pale ales aged in cliffside caverns. 
	- *Shieldgate Barracks:* the stout eastern gatehouse where recruits spar atop white stone walls
	- *Kestrel Eyrie:* a ranger outpost doubling as a rookery for messenger hawks
	- *Tidesage Chapel:* seaside shrine sunk partway into a fault where priests read the surf for omens and prophecy
	- *Plateau Archives*: a half-buried library preserving maps of eroding cliff routes and lost steppes
- Here, Grickma told the party their audience with Mara (the Mayor) and her governors was in 30 minutes, so the group explored. 
	- Kiro, Deion went to the Market, called *Windcarve Market*. Deion searched for the adventuring-types but couldn't find any. He thinks he might find some at the Saltstone Brewery. Kiro and Deion traded a +1 Greatsword for a set of Pipes of the Sewers.
	- Valyra visited the library, called *Plateau Archives*. Here she met the librarian, named *Denya Moorcrest*, a tiefling.
- Valyra's conversation with Denya was important
	- Denya relayed that the town, while functioning was in low spirits. The attacks 2 months ago and the lack of trade is a heavy burden on the town.
	- Denya listed 3 possible side-quests that could raise the spirits
		1. Sages have been going missing. Help the Sages of Tidesage Chapel purge a possible ghost from their caverns. People rely on the Chapel for reassurance and have been scared of it as of late. 
		2. The mayor's pet has gone missing. Rumor has it, the pet ran for the Whispering Aqueduct. The pet is well loved and retrieving it would bolster both the Mayor's and the town's spirts.  
		3. The brewery is producing bad ale. The master brewer, *Korrin Bleachbay*, believes something is amiss in the caves beneath the brewery, where they keep their stores. The brewery is an iconic landmark of the town and people look to it as staple. 
	- Denya is offering a scroll of Revivify for each task completed. 
- The group reunited and ventured into the main hall to converse with Mara, the mayor
- The following are key discussion points from the meeting
	- Group informs Mara of attacks in 9 days, numbering in at least 250+ Aquans. Town's guard has a max of 250 soldiers, most new recruits. Town is 5-6K people.
	- Group informs Mara of bioweapon made from Yellow Cap Killers possibly being used and that it is ignitable with fire.
	- Group learns that [[Tennyson Heralds]], 20 ish years ago, was a sage at the temple but went adventuring in the east and did not return.
	- Group learns that Sages of the Tidesage Chapel pray to both Everlight and Stormlord. Sages of Stormlord felt massive presence of Stormlord passing in seas. They recorded it being potent with Illusory magic. This was 1 month ago. 
- The group then heads to private chambers with just Mara and Grickma to further discuss matters in private
	- Group relays that they need to go to Sunken Caverns, Mara is scared, recounts local legend that the [[Sunken Caverns]] are bottomless.
	- Mara informs group that letter was delivered from "His Majesty" saying a troop of [[Gandoria]]'s soldiers are enroute to [[Trawlrock]], following the coast road. 
	- Kiro inquires about how to mitigate effects of depths in [[Sunken Caverns]] and Mara says to converse with the Sages.

The group told me, Ethan, that they want to talk to the sages (priests) next session and ask the rescued Miners if anyone is willing to accompany them on their quest to the [[Sunken Caverns]].
