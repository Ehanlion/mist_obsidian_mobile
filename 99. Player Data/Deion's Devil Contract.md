[[Deion Deus]] has enacted a contract with [[Yugo Stolid]]. It was offered because [[Yugo Stolid]] could save [[Deion Deus]] and [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] from death at the battle of Saddleport. [[Deion Deus]] offered to give [[Yugo Stolid]] an open-ended favor at a time of [[Yugo Stolid]]'s choosing. This is a forcing clause where, if [[Deion Deus]] refuses, he will have to face the consequences of [[Executing Devil Contracts]] and the refusal section.
