[[Kelswin Lovejoy]], son of [[Vivian Lovejoy]], is a Satyr, Diviniation Wizard hailing from [[The Whitecliff Plateau]]. He lives with his adopted mother, [[Vivian Lovejoy]] here after being orphaned as a child. [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] is happy-go-lucky, but has been challenged by the world of [[Mist]] after his mother was captured by [[The Aquan Nations]]. [[Kelswin Lovejoy]] is intended to be a good-intending character, he does not use any charm-ish magic and mind control magic, and is deeply inquisitive. 

**Retiring Kelswin**
Chris might want to retire Kelswin after recsuing Vivian. It would make perfect sense to retire kelswin after rescuing Vivian and then bring in a new character after that. Kelswin is on good terms with the party and might rejoin them later.
