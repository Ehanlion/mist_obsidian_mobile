[[Kiro Rickshaha]] is a Verdan (Goblin/Hobgoblin hybrid), Celestrial Warlock/Paladin multiclass played by Jay. They hail from the [[Bogbeast Swamps]] (far in the east). Their father was forced into a contract with [[The Woman of the Woods]] while a slave to [[Fedorov's Legion]]. This then "forced" [[Kiro Rickshaha]] into a contract with that same patron.
