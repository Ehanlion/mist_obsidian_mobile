[[Cdogspyro]] is one of my players for my original Mist Campaign.

I think this player is best motivated by less combat more things to discover. One of the biggest complaints I've heard from them is that they are not a fan of Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition combat. I on the other hand as a GM really like the combat in dungeons and dragons. I think they will always be a little bit of a mismatch on our play style so the best that I can do is to try and add mystery, intrigue, and elements of the story that can be discovered without having combat as the core motivator for that.
