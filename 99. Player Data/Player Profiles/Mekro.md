[[Mekro]] is one of my players for my original Mist Campaign. 

I have a lot of interesting things to say about this player. He has certainly demonstrated himself to be probably the most versatile and well adapted player that I get to play with. I find that he complains a lot when things don't necessarily go his way and while I have a hunch, he's joking most of the time it's sometimes hard to decipher this. However, he is also the most engaged player, and I always feel that despite him not writing down a lot of stuff he has a very, very good habit of remembering the things that are happening during the actual session, which is extraordinarily supportive for me as a game master.

I feel like I can always rely on Mekro to be willing to roleplay something, lead the story, or lead the party somewhere. He feels like a natural center to the party and for that, I am greatful.
