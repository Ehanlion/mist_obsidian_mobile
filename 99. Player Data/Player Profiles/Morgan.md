[[Morgan]] is one of my players for my original Mist Campaign. 

With this player, I feel like there are a lot of different elements and issues that I as the game master have to manage. They have a very strong and repeated habit of going on their phone during a session which I have always found to be a little bit strange because one of the things that they've said that they like the most from the campaign is actually the mystery and the unfolding of story elements. The reason I find it so interesting is that they quite often tell me that they are lost or at least they tell me to repeat parts of a story or they ask me what we are doing Dewing During an actual session so it's always felt a little bit strange to me. This parody between oh I want to learn more about mystery in the actual story and I'm going to go on Twitter on my phone and be distracted.

With this player, I think that they are a Meta gamer. Not the sense that Meta gaming is bad or inherently evil. I just think they're Meta gamer in the way that they like to build the well optimize character. I have absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, they also have a propensity for trying their best to break the rules of the game, which really bothers me. I do my best to run the games that are interesting and challenging and I have a very DM. So it feels as though they had any chance possible Try to come up with these strange deliberately game breaking approaches to problems and that has always really bothered me.
