[[Thor]] is one of my players for my original Mist Campaign. 
# Player Analysis 
This player is my newest player, and is also the newest to dungeons and dragons. I think they are quieter than the other players and I often feel bad because sometimes I overlook them because I expect my players to tell me that they want to try something and not for me to always ask. They are also the slowest in combat. I find that, despite playing a spellcaster with many spells, that they always use only 3 or 4 spells and they take ages to decide to just do this as well. I think they need to find a way to expedite their turns in order to quicken combat.
