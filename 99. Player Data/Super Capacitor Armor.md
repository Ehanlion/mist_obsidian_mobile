**Description**
This armor fuels itself off of taking damage. The more damage you take the more charges the armor gains to expend. The more charges you expend the more powerful of an effect you generate. 

**Visual flair**
The more damage you take the more the armor begins to glow and shimmer. When you release charges, the armor erupts and crackles with potent energy flares.

> **Description:** This Armor transfuses damage against the wearer into usable energy. Damage the wearer takes can be conferred into energy for the armor. 
> 
> **Gaining Charges**: For every 10 hit points the wearer loses, the armor gains 1 charge, up to a maximum of 3/5/7/9 (depends on rarity).
> 
> **Charges**: The armor holds 3/5/7/9 charges depending on rarity. At the end of the wearer's turn, if at least one charge has not be gained or if a charge has not been used, the armor loses one charge. 
> 
> **Using Charges**: Charges are spent to generate various effects. Some effects have a variable number of charges that can be spent on it. Only one effect may be used per turn. 
> 
> **Stored Abilities**: The armor has the potential to unleash various effects, but is limited to the number it can generate at any given time. Similar the a spellcaster preparing spells, the armor "prepares" abilities during a long rest. Changing the abilities of the armor requires a DC 20 Arcana check and 8 hours. The armor can prepare 1/2/3/4 abilities depending on its rarity.
