[[Valyra Malzan]] is a Levistus Tiefling Wild-magic Sorcerer played by Ashley. [[Valyra Malzan]] hails from [[Green Order]] and was exiled for a contract taken with [[Umbral Cabal]]. This contract granted [[Valyra Malzan]] saftey from an oncoming Red Greatwyrm but inbued her powers with chaos, hence the wild magic.
