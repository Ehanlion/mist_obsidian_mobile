**This Dungeon** should emulate the ecosystem put forward by Rainworld, the game on Steam. I love the way the game feels organic and lifelike. I want this to feel like players entering the dungeon are apart of something bigger. Other massive creatures, organisms, and structures permute the landscape and the players must traverse it.

# Key Regions
**The main goal**
- each region is unique and separate
- They must be isolated from each other
- Each region
- each region must have urban-super structure parts that create a hidden foundation. As if something massive and undiscovered was built here. 
# Mystery?
This could be a cool element to integrate as something that was actually created by one of [[The Many]] and then their death energized it with magic and life. Maybe the architecture could originate as a *creation* of [[The Many]] and then the creatures could originate from the *death* of one of [[The Many]] in the given region. A Shard could also be buried here.
