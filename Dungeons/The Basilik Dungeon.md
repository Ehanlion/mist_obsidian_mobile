*Dungeon idea I had while reading the 2024 monster manual.*

_ _ _ _
# The Concept
I love the idea of having a dungeon where the primary, dominant enemies are **overgrown Basilisk.** I think having statues of stone, frozen, scared adventurers could be a really funny lead in to the actual dungeon.

**Lead in**
- the lead in could be a long stone passageway leading in from somewhere.
- It should feel dungeon-esque. This can be a carved passage like a dungeon entrance with a carved archway to lead in.
- This is where the petrified people should be located
- Then at the end there is an open, stone archway leading in further, except this part looks like it has life in it. 

**Main**
- a complex of hallways and rooms of what clearly could have been an old lab or structure are now overrun with underground flora and fauna
- The apex predator here is **the Basilisk**. 
- Plenty of statues here of creatures but also plenty of indicators that there are basilisk

# The Mystery
This place could have been a lab of [[The Many]]. Maybe someone *used it incorrectly* after their time and accidentally created powerful Basalisk creatures here. 

There can be plenty of varieties of Basalisk. Maybe invisible ones. Fast ones. Strong ones. Magic ones. Get inspired by **Rainworld** when creating things here.
