**Location idea:** a creature, not a person, located somewhere dark and scary. A place known to be devoid of hope and magic. This is designed to be a scary creature of devouring and should be put somewhere to reflect that. 

# Magic Eater
Any magic item [[The Palantear]] touches fizzles and rusts into oblivion. An item touched in this way rusts and becomes non magical, loosing all of its magical properties. 

This effect extends to items that *hit* [[The Palantear]] as well, e.g. a sword or spear that touches it are destroyed in this way.
