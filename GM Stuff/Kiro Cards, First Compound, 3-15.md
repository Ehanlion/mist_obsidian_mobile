**Cards**
- *1-8* : I want this card be a easy to get reward. I think it should include something like a basic bit of lore and maybe a tiny bit of information about the world.
- *9-13*: this card should include something like a mundane item or something that could possibly be useful or possibly a trinket. It should feel relatively special, but not anything crazy.
- *14-17*: this card is the second rarest card. It should include something like a description of an enemy, and a powerful clue about how to solve the final battle. It should also elaborate on how the airlock works towards the right side of the dungeon.
- *18-19*: this card is relatively rare. I think it should be hard to get. I think it should include something like a uncommon or rare magical item as well as an important bit of information about how to free the miners from the final battle room.
- *20*: get all cards on table
