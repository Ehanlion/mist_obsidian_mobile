## Warp Places?
I noticed on Brittle Hollow and Timber Hearth there are these locations with glowing orange lines and these white glowing squares with a small thing in the center.

I visited the White Hole Station and found one, but the square is purple and am being told it is "Keyed" to astral bodies?

An "alignment" is necessary (big dial with planet & arrow pointing towards Brittle Hollow in White Hole Station) and you warp if you stand in the warp zone during alignment

Okay yeah I was right about the other locations. So Timber Hearth has a warp pair somewhere?
