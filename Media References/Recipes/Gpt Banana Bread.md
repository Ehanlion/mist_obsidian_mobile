| All‑purpose flour | 2 ½ cups (315 g) |
| Granulated sugar | 1 cup (200 g) |
| Baking soda | 1 tsp (5 g) |
| Salt | ½ tsp (2.5 g) |

| Eggs | 2 large |
| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp (5 ml) |

| Ripe bananas, mashed (about 3 medium) | 1 cup (≈225 g) |
| Optional – chopped walnuts or chocolate chips | ½ cup (75 g) |

### Equipment
- 9 × 5‑inch loaf pan (or two 8 × 4‑inch pans)
- Mixing bowls
- Rubber spatula or wooden spoon
- Measuring cups & spoons
- Cooling rack
### Instructions
1. **Preheat the oven**: to 350 °F (175 °C). Grease the loaf pan with butter or line with parchment paper.
2. **Combine dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. **Mix wet ingredients**: In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then whisk in the melted butter, vanilla extract, milk, and mashed bananas until smooth.
4. **Fold the wet into the dry**  Pour the banana mixture into the flour mixture. Stir gently with a spatula or wooden spoon just until incorporated—be careful not to over‑mix; a few streaks of flour are okay.
5. **Add optional mix‑ins**:  Fold in chopped walnuts or chocolate chips if using.
6. **Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50–60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean or with a few crumbs.
7. **Cool**:  Let the loaf cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then turn onto a cooling rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!
