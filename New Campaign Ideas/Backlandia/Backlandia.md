I was sitting in my backyard thinking about life, drinking a watermelon-apple cooler that I made when I had this idea. What if there was a D&D campaign with miniature people? 

The cities would be miniature towns underground in this woodland area between the backyards of giant mansion houses. The peoples would be unlta tiny, maybe half an inch tall at the most. 

Actually I am not sure about scale. I would want to scale it around a small actual D&D creature appearing as something like a gargantuan creature. So maybe creatures are an inch or so tall or something. Not really sure.

Regardless the terrain is a dense wilderness woods, one barrier is the backyards and fences to houses while the other is a raging set of rapids. Both seem massive to the little people because a giant white water river at normal scale is a tyrannical ocean at little scale while a fence is an unscaleably tall cliff. 

This would make a fun setting for a one shot of sorts. 

Magic would exist normally, except only for the little people. The homeowners and creatures would be just normal creatures of a dense woodland forest. Spiders, moles, squirrels, bears, etc all would be HUGE threats to miniature people.
