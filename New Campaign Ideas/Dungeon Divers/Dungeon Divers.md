**Preface**
I had this campaign idea while I was out walking. I had this idea for a campaign that plays a lot more like a video game than dungeons and dragons. It extends the main D&D system but places classes, level-ups, ability scores, and items into a more *customizable* format. The main just is that players all start classless, itemless, and with the same ability scores (8s and10s). Then they explore a mega-dungeon world 

## Character Creation

- Ability Scores 
- HIt points
- Classes, abilities, items

**Basics on creating a character**
*Start by selecting a background for your character. Then select a race. Your background will grant you basic skill proficiencies. You may not use Tasha's for this campaign. That means you cannot respec background skills nor your racial ability score bonuses. Do not select a class. You do not start with one! You are a "level 0" character!*
### Ability Scores
All players start with a default array of scores:
- 4 Ability scores get to be 10s
- 2 Ability scores are considered *weaknesses* and get to be 8s
- Some scores are modified by your race!

It is important to note that for this campaign, you should select "weaker" skills based on your **background** and not your class. You do not start with a class! But you do select a background for your character. 

For this example I selected by background (doesn't matter for this example), then I chose a half-orc (STR +2, CON +1) for my race, where I did *not* respec the ability score improvements with Tasha's. 

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12  | 10  | 11  | 8   | 8   | 10  |
### Hit Points
How hit points work:
- Everyone starts as a level 0 character
- I will give each character `1d10 + CON` hit points to start
- This starts your character with 1 hit die, a `1d10`
- Then when you gain a class, that is treated as your "level-up" and you roll the hit die for that new class and add the roll to your overall health total

### Classes and Multiclassing

TLDR: Class tokens are equivalent to level ups. Use class tokens to gain levels in classes

**Gaining Classes**
- You gain classes from **class tokens**
- These are unique tokens for each class, randomly given
- Using a token grants you a level in that class
- There is not milestone nor exp levelling, instead tokens serve as the levelling mechanic
- For instance, if I gain 2 fighter tokens and 1 wizard token, I can become a Level 3 character with multiclass of 2-Fighter, 1-Wizard.

**Multiclassing**
- Multiclassing is very easy
- Tokens are levels in classes
- You can multiclass by using tokens from different classes, gaining those classes *without having to meet the ability score requirements of those classes!*
