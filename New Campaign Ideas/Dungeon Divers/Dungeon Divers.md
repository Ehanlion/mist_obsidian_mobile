**Preface**
I had this campaign idea while I was out walking. I had this idea for a campaign that plays a lot more like a video game than dungeons and dragons. It extends the main D&D system but places classes, level-ups, ability scores, and items into a more *customizable* format. The main just is that players all start classless, itemless, and with the same ability scores (8s and10s). Then they explore a mega-dungeon world 

## Character Sheet

This campaign setting functions by giving characters **side quests** to complete from their backstory. Each character can select easy, medium, or hard objectives (with final say from GM) to choose for their character. Keep these secret or share them. You and the GM will agree upon a reasonable reward for completion such as a **feat, item, or class level-up.**
