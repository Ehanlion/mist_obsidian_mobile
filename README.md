# This Repository
This is a repository I maintain for mobile work on the Mist campaign. It is a brainstorming collection of my thoughts that serves as an ancillary to the primary Mist repository. It is also a streamlined, reduced version of my primary **Mist** repository and serves as a compressed variant of only the most essential, currently-in-use files and concepts. That way, in my new ideas, I can reference the current campaign-relevant material.

# Mist
[[Mist]] is a world of magic, mystery, and danger. The world can best be divided into 4 main quadrants, split into natural regions. In the north-west lies [[The Whitecliff Plateau]], a vaulted steppe of plains, adorned by the jewel of [[Gandoras City]] and [[The Seat of Stone]]. In the north-east lies [[The Greenheart Wilderness]], a chaotic and wild forest wraught with ancient magic, creatures of the moon, and strange abberations. To the east lies [[The Chromatic Fangs]], the spine of [[Mist]]. These fearsome peaks naturally divide into the frosty, northern reaches of [[The Frigid Crucible]] and the fiery, southern reaches of [[The Scorvorrian Peaks]]. Beyond these lies the ruthless lands of [[The Stormlocked Frontier]], with the great city of [[Hope Town]] standing stoic in the north here. To the south are other regions, but these are widely unexplored in the current context and when they become relevant, I shall write to describe them. Underlying the entire island is a mystery about the founders. Vast super structures, monuments, and creations riddle the island. Who created them? Why were they created? Why is there no access to other planes? Why are the gods not able to set foot on [[Mist]]? These questions remain unanswered, wrapped in mystery, waiting to be solved. Welcome to [[Mist]].

The current campaign dwells on [[The Whitecliff Plateau]], seeking to stop [[The Aquan Nations]], kill [[Karak-Ulgurath]], and rescue [[Vivian Lovejoy]] from the clutches of these foes. The party must discover the insidious ties between [[The Aquan Nations]], [[Fedorov's Legion]], [[The Umbral Cabal]], [[The Iron-Fist Marauders]], and [[The Followers of Alsolace]] to understand the gravity of this situation and the grave danger that [[The Seat of Stone]] is really in.
