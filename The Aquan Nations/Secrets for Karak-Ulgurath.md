# Illusory Secrets
Have documents to be found that show how [[Karak-Ulgurath]] can be shrouded in illusion by [[Fedorov's Legion]] to make it appear much larger than normal. This Illusion is a part of the **Shrine to the Stormlord** and can be activated with a powerful incantation, requiring a 7th level spell slot. 

[[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s normal size is **Gargantuan** (20ft by 20ft base but claws extend further out with reach) and around around 40 feet tall. 

[[Karak-Ulgurath]]'s size when **enhanced with illusory magic** is 200ft by 200ft and around 300 to 400 feet tall. To spot this magic requires a successful DC 20 Arcana check.
