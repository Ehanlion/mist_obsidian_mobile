I had this idea that for quickly exploring something (a city, uninteresting parts of dungeons, forest, wherever) that I *pre-create* a suite of *loot cards* that serves as discoverable things. 

**Example from being in bathroom**
Jay is missing first part of session. To make it quick for game to get stuff for Kiro when they get there, I want to have loot cards.

Each one has a lore tidbit, and item, a bit of info about the dungeon, a description of an enemy, whatever. 

I create 4 cards. 
Jay rolls a D20. 
- first card is gotten on 1-6
- Second on 7-13
- Third on 14-16
- Fourth on 17-19
- And all 4 in a nat 20
 
*Most important:* these cards are labelled and placed on the table BEFORE they roll. This is a vote of confidence saying "yes, I the GM already created these for you to discover and if you DONT get one, you can discover it later!"

This feels **super** applicable to a lot of stuff and could make it pretty cool!

**Expanding to skill checks**
Let's say they explore a city. I can have cards that are now a range more than 20. A Nat 20 always gets all cards or a selection they choose a subset or something idk yet. 

I can have cards for Arcana, nature, athletics, stealth, perception whatever, with the rule that you can only attempt one! I can even double up on some if its really applicable! Show them cards ahead of time too but not the contents, just what to roll and how hard it is

Players can work together on one, but they both commit to going for that one card set. One player rolls with advantage as them both contribute to the task at hand! 

*Example*
- athletics 1-10
- Athletics 11-15
- Athletics 16-20
- Athletics 21-25
- This is a hard challenge! A 25 means something on that card is SERIOUSLY cool and worth getting!
